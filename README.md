# Theravatars Project  

## Description  
The **Theravatars Project** aims to develop a **virtual patient** to provide psychologists in training with a platform to enhance their **soft skills** in a wide range of clinical scenarios.  

Currently, soft skills training relies primarily on **role-playing** with fellow students, which limits exposure to the complexity of real-world clinical practice. Alternative methods, such as practicing with actors, are difficult to organize and financially burdensome. As a result, students may not be adequately prepared for professional challenges.  

This project explores **automatic emotion recognition** in dialogue interactions, enabling the virtual patient to express emotions naturally. By engaging with the virtual patient, trainees can **practice diagnosing** based on both conversation content and emotional expressions.  

### Key Features:  
- **Virtual Patient Interaction** â€“ Allows trainees to engage in **realistic conversations** with an AI-driven virtual patient.  
- **Emotion Recognition** â€“ Integrates **automatic emotion detection** into dialogue interactions to enhance authenticity.  
- **Flexible & Scalable Training** â€“ Provides a **diverse range of scenarios**, overcoming the limitations of traditional role-playing.  
- **AI Research & Development** â€“ Supports SMEs in advancing AI applications in **healthcare** and **training environments**.  

By offering a more **realistic**, **interactive**, and **accessible** training environment, the Theravatars Project helps bridge the gap between academic learning and professional clinical practice.
