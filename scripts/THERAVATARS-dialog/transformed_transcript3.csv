146708.0;160278.0;no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but;awesome what's your dream job
161458.0;184658.0;my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment;mhm how hard is that
185978.0;210898.0;um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult;yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days
211108.0;212888.0;yep;what do you do now
213688.0;220228.0;i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh;cool

227338.0;241418.0;um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah;okay how close are you to your family
242008.0;256058.0;i'm pretty close i mean they're around so;hmm what are some things that make you really mad
257418.0;281438.0;um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all;mhm can you give me an example of that
283018.0;315698.0;um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so;right when was the last time that happened
317728.0;338478.0;uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back;i understand do you consider yourself an introvert
339648.0;345838.0;what do you mean;let's come back to that later
345848.0;348408.0;okay;what do you do to relax
349438.0;379838.0;god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative;awesome who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
381198.0;403098.0;who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't;mhm
403148.0;419318.0;it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there;like what
420078.0;450428.0;you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time;mmm that's good how are you at controlling your temper
451948.0;458208.0;um i guess it depends on who you talk to;<laughter>
457888.0;472138.0;i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it;can you give me an example of that
473298.0;503618.0;well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better;that's good have you been diagnosed with depression
504238.0;507738.0;no;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
508218.0;511028.0;no;have you ever served in the military
511298.0;516408.0;no;okay is there anything you regret
518208.0;563778.0;um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so;right there are always trade offs in life aren't there
563948.0;566548.0;yeah;what made you decide to do that
565218.0;600998.0;so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so;that sounds really hard
602078.0;640838.0;no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you;right that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences
642398.0;692328.0;memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere;that's great
691628.0;704628.0;maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire;yeah i see what you mean
704798.0;712398.0;yeah;when was the last time you felt really happy
714098.0;759348.0;um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy;that's great how would your best friend describe you
760978.0;797868.0;i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as;okay okay i think i've asked everything i need to

118216.0;145856.0;well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature;mhm that sounds like a great situation 
146156.0;148296.0;thanks;how hard is that
148596.0;172706.0;well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible ;that makes sense  do you consider yourself an introvert

209186.0;239416.0;well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated;has that gotten you in trouble

311866.0;346856.0;well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature;mhm  tell me about your kids
347426.0;356116.0;i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old;aw

376376.0;385466.0;the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and;yeah
386676.0;418616.0;they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can;yeah i see what you mean what's one of your most memorable experiences 
419696.0;425746.0;with my kids or just period;whatever comes to your mind
428976.0;435216.0;what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know;wow
439796.0;462196.0;and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me ;that's so good to hear
462226.0;465256.0;thank you;how did you feel in that moment 
465436.0;512206.0;happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week;yeah that sounds like a great situation 
512196.0;516806.0;thank you;what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
517656.0;582316.0;hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career;right yeah could you have done anything to avoid it
582756.0;609356.0;i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so ;yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there 
609306.0;616776.0;yes;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
618846.0;656846.0;my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but;right
664236.0;668156.0;that just happened you know i just told her i'm not;how close are you to them
668336.0;670886.0;i'm sorry;how close are you to them

683386.0;703406.0;she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite;mhm
704066.0;723226.0;and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change;yeah how hard is that
723636.0;742946.0;it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but;yeah yeah

349270.0;377740.0;um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> ;oh my gosh
379990.0;399320.0;and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that;yeah that sucks

425865.0;427735.0;dishonesty;when was the last time that happened
427585.0;430135.0;pardon me;when was the last time that happened 
430175.0;446975.0;uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes;mm
451685.0;461075.0;you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that;yeah that sucks
461275.0;466255.0;yeah big time;what do you do when you're annoyed
467005.0;470055.0;what do i do when i'm annoyed;mhm
469895.0;507765.0;um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek;wow yeah how hard is that
508455.0;519565.0;uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions;yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
520745.0;534485.0;um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything;mhm
534415.0;560975.0;and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all;yeah how did you feel in that moment
561385.0;564615.0;pardon me;how did you feel in that moment
565445.0;600885.0;um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so;mhm
600725.0;631335.0;you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship;i'm sorry to hear that
631665.0;636935.0;can't do nothing about it;what are some things you like to do for fun
637805.0;709555.0;uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like;that's great what's one of your most memorable experiences
710865.0;723755.0;uh most memorable experiences um good or bad;whatever comes to your mind

818435.0;822545.0;have i done anything to avoid it;yes
823155.0;829375.0;um to avoid them;yes
829945.0;852915.0;uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so;i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
854155.0;890995.0;um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so;yeah
890885.0;909375.0;i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired;mhm do you feel that way often
909795.0;916855.0;uh lately i have been probably about the last few months;what are you like when you don't sleep well
917245.0;941915.0;um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head;mhm
941915.0;988065.0;and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that ;mm how do you cope with them
988525.0;991625.0;how do i what;how do you cope with them
991995.0;1027845.0;how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews;mm
1036065.0;1055025.0;uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me;yeah has that gotten you in trouble
1058165.0;1065965.0;if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean;yeah
1066425.0;1120225.0;um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done ;mhm
1122515.0;1175365.0;uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities ;mhm that's good do you feel like therapy is useful
1175665.0;1178445.0;pardon me;do you feel like therapy is useful
1181065.0;1183965.0;i still didn't hear you;do you feel like therapy is useful
1185905.0;1199405.0;that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time;why don't we talk about that later
1199405.0;1206865.0;alright;have you been diagnosed with depression
1207675.0;1213565.0;uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism;how hard is that
1214705.0;1233685.0;um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know;mhm
1233215.0;1303635.0;um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just;yeah
1304385.0;1331165.0;and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um;mm
1330985.0;1349905.0;but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way ;yeah
1349535.0;1362985.0;so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad ;i understand did you think you had a problem before you found out
1365395.0;1370075.0;did i have a problem before i got out;did you think you had a problem before you found out
1370445.0;1418545.0;uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know;yeah
1418095.0;1424105.0;me me dealing with life so;how has seeing a therapist affected you
1424745.0;1427765.0;pardon me;how has seeing a therapist affected you
1428455.0;1493615.0;uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know;right
1494055.0;1495845.0;but it's good to have;that's so good to hear
1495955.0;1500965.0;yeah;what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
1501245.0;1523465.0;well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will;why did you stop
1523865.0;1539235.0;um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um ;yeah

1579605.0;1597915.0;um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know;mhm

117153.0;139003.0;it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace;yeah yeah how hard is that
139263.0;154883.0;uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others;mhm that makes sense what's your dream job
155773.0;160863.0;oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm;really why
161363.0;177583.0;oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field;cool how close are you to your family

279613.0;294913.0;i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work;wow yeah do you find it easy to be a parent
295053.0;308753.0;uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing;mhm what's the hardest thing about being a parent
308813.0;321063.0;uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good;yeah can you give me an example of that
321723.0;348403.0;scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us;that sounds really hard what do you think of today's kids
348433.0;384923.0;um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now;yeah i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
385013.0;392173.0;um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy;do you feel that way often
392373.0;400713.0;um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work;when was the last time that happened
400763.0;406733.0;oh gosh about a couple weeks ago;how did you feel in that moment
406723.0;423793.0;oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you;mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well
424243.0;431583.0;um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed;that sounds really hard
431423.0;435303.0;mhm;do you feel down
435823.0;451783.0;um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested;yeah have you been diagnosed with depression
451823.0;456673.0;uh not depression;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
456673.0;493283.0;um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know;mhm i'm sorry to hear that what got you to seek help
493813.0;518893.0;um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down;yeah
523023.0;532983.0;from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx;hmm
533963.0;535663.0;back back;what were your symptoms
535783.0;558393.0;just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know;yeah have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
558563.0;577393.0;well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing;do you feel like therapy is useful
578753.0;582933.0;i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question;do you feel like therapy is useful

54580.0;56740.0;<laughter>;where are you from originally
57670.0;62966.0;um moscow;really why'd you move to l_a
63338.0;72213.0;um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
72824.0;90086.0; uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though;that's good how do you like your living situation
90657.0;97918.0;it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between;[laughter]
97891.0;111006.0;the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while;yeah how do you know them
111371.0;117183.0;one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist;how close are you to them
117952.0;134049.0;it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant;aww tell me more about that
134399.0;137428.0;oh about the distant;yes
137445.0;146616.0;okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room;uh oh
152241.0;170510.0;and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move ;yeah that sucks
170801.0;179302.0;it's okay it'll get better;yeah how are you at controlling your temper
181018.0;204949.0;it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger;why
205499.0;211609.0;oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter];[laughter] that makes sense
211837.0;215939.0;yeah;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
216436.0;227438.0;uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah;wow

239931.0;243179.0;uh my friend nicole;yeah
243179.0;262139.0;um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then;nice
262139.0;265870.0;mhm;what are some things you like to do for fun
267424.0;291318.0;um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever;okay how close are you to your family
291916.0;310181.0;uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them;mm
310279.0;313538.0;so i guess superficially close;okay
312858.0;317097.0;but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess;that's good
317172.0;321208.0;mhm;what are some things that make you really mad
324024.0;369930.0;uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess;yeah  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
370680.0;405100.0;uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through;[laughter] yeah do you feel that way often
406385.0;411879.0;about other people or about myself or angry;whatever comes to your mind
412361.0;428059.0;xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often;okay what's your dream job
428864.0;491166.0;dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so;mhm yeah
492490.0;508850.0;something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess;okay do you travel a lot
508991.0;521077.0;i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries;wow
521057.0;535144.0;i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome;yeah
535175.0;544800.0;um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot;what do you enjoy about traveling
545626.0;571234.0;in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up;i see what you mean i'd love to hear about one of your trips
572729.0;601487.0;oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon;oh my gosh
601477.0;658206.0;i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too;yeah i see what you mean
661116.0;664033.0;cool;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
665498.0;677486.0;um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy;what are you like when you don't sleep well
678375.0;691210.0;oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world;do you feel that way often
691875.0;706965.0;i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
709758.0;733744.0;uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing;yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days
733861.0;744359.0;yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for;mhm
749980.0;776410.0;so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know;that sounds really hard
776759.0;809490.0;yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so;yeah do you feel down
810629.0;817531.0;uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter];nice
818194.0;854259.0;yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation;yeah i'm sorry
854589.0;858080.0;it's all good;have you been diagnosed with depression
859168.0;873447.0;uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds;okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
873736.0;876848.0;nope;have you ever served in the military
877123.0;883361.0;nope;okay what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
885505.0;912003.0;oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago;like what
912839.0;969882.0;well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense;yeah yeah what do you do to relax
972545.0;1005225.0;uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so;yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences 
1006843.0;1032377.0;[laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year;aww
1035378.0;1055801.0;and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing ;mhm
1055554.0;1093764.0;um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one;that's great

109780.0;114680.0;okay i'm cutting you off;do you travel a lot
115980.0;119330.0;not as much as i used to;why
120370.0;132760.0;um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt;what do you enjoy about traveling
133900.0;140080.0;i don't i don't enjoy traveling;what'd you study at school
141310.0;150310.0;uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly;are you still working in that
151310.0;155140.0;yes i am actually;what do you do now
156240.0;167610.0;right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire;awesome
168600.0;170030.0;impressive;what's your dream job
171790.0;181000.0;professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest;<laughter>
182430.0;187690.0;you're actually pretty good at this;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
190190.0;212790.0;<sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning;mhm that's so good to hear
215220.0;219810.0;okay;how are you at controlling your temper
221260.0;227160.0;i'm pretty good i think;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
230120.0;251890.0;i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all;okay how close are you to your family
253360.0;277440.0;fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also;aw that's good
278480.0;281240.0;interesting;do you consider yourself an introvert
282210.0;284470.0;yes;why
285570.0;296780.0;because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted;i see what you mean what do you do to relax
298510.0;308740.0;i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least;cool what do you do when you're annoyed
309990.0;324990.0;i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think;okay what do you think of today's kids
325980.0;345350.0;<deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion;mm that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences 
348310.0;386370.0;<sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry;awesome
387940.0;391500.0;thank you;how would your best friend describe you
393970.0;403750.0;i don't really have a best friend introverted remember;okay what would you say are some of your best qualities
405290.0;438930.0;i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing;what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
441880.0;458840.0;when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood;nice
459690.0;464080.0;thank you;what are you most proud of in your life
467320.0;480390.0;right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all;tell me more about that
482000.0;523580.0;interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid;yeah
525830.0;528340.0;okay;when was the last time you felt really happy
531670.0;539000.0;um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class;cool

577290.0;580830.0;yes not really;how did serving in the military change you
584630.0;595020.0;i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much;mm what did you do after the military
595480.0;603830.0;graduate school in physics;okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d

607200.0;611070.0;nope;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep

161642.0;189880.0;um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live;okay do you consider yourself an introvert
190265.0;193220.0;no not at all;why
194585.0;219945.0;just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people;that's good what do you do to relax
220900.0;253645.0;um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas;nice what are some things that make you really mad
254800.0;300965.0;um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that;okay what's the best thing about being a parent
301980.0;358040.0;um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff;uh huh what's the hardest thing about being a parent
359135.0;401930.0;the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom;i see what you mean there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there
402005.0;407590.0;mhm always;who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life
408650.0;413350.0;i'm sorry i didn't get what you said;what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life 
413340.0;452105.0;um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life;how are you at controlling your temper
453180.0;499210.0;um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up;that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
499475.0;531805.0;um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all;that sounds really hard
532055.0;536745.0;mhm it is it can be mhm;what do you think of today's kids
537985.0;596440.0;i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible;yeah how would your best friend describe you
599120.0;657345.0;mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship;aw have you ever served in the military

685645.0;698255.0;um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great;are they triggered by something
698240.0;700615.0;huh;are they triggered by something
701410.0;714990.0;um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance ;oh
714760.0;718170.0;in my brain;how have you been feeling lately
718620.0;767580.0;i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them;i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
768805.0;782010.0;um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night;why
781350.0;785140.0;um to go to the bathroom basically;oh
785140.0;806705.0;and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors;that sucks
806855.0;810955.0;yeah sometimes it does;what are you like when you don't sleep well
811845.0;829277.0;mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful;okay
835172.0;850912.0;they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more;uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
851652.0;859712.0;uh not really not not no not really not anything significant;do you feel like therapy is useful
859702.0;861892.0;huh;do you feel like therapy is useful
862377.0;867847.0;um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful;tell me more about that
868212.0;938610.0;um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think;that's so good to hear what got you to seek help
939460.0;958135.0;oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all;that's great when was the last time you felt really happy
959390.0;976950.0;um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan;aw
976457.0;993870.0; uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful;wow
993925.0;1016600.0;very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so;what are some things that usually put you in a good mood
1017485.0;1077017.0;um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished;mhm what's your dream job
1078102.0;1086602.0;dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um;really
1086922.0;1127650.0;yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members;what made you decide to do that
1128325.0;1165450.0;um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery;uh huh
1165470.0;1191965.0;but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been;how hard is that
1192860.0;1236727.0;um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like ;wow
1236797.0;1242542.0;two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um;[laughter]
1242537.0;1254622.0;it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do;what's one of your most memorable experiences
1255890.0;1263415.0;um in all of life or in your job;whatever comes to your mind
1263795.0;1271510.0;uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children;how did you feel in that moment
1272555.0;1299120.0;um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth;that sounds like a great situation
1297190.0;1313932.0;and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences;mhm is there anything you regret
1315157.0;1329007.0;um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny;[laughter]
1328092.0;1348067.0;and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that;oh no
1347352.0;1359127.0;my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that;yeah
1358677.0;1364027.0;so;what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
1366802.0;1424234.0;now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things;that makes sense
1426824.0;1468004.0;what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it;that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities
1468664.0;1516139.0;um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough;yeah thanks for sharing your thoughts with me

97970.0;117480.0;that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too ;yeah yeah what'd you study at school
118044.0;126210.0;i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology;wow that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that
127017.0;146530.0;i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it ;nice what's your dream job
148401.0;179410.0;everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter>;okay do you travel a lot
179635.0;182670.0;i do um;what do you enjoy about traveling
183045.0;188880.0;i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
190245.0;206300.0;well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving;wow what are some things that make you really mad
208250.0;219220.0;i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up;mhm what do you do when you're annoyed
221608.0;229510.0;vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>;<laughter> yes how are you at controlling your temper
230362.0;253100.0;i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control ;that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
253280.0;284190.0;<laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight;aww that's good what do you do to relax
284960.0;298130.0;um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people ;okay how close are you to your family
298740.0;327690.0;i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground;i see what you mean do you consider yourself an introvert
328700.0;350830.0;yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge ;mhm how would your best friend describe you
352060.0;377220.0;i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  ;that's great what are you most proud of in your life
379720.0;403450.0;i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that;that's so good to hear
404340.0;406290.0;<laughter>;have you ever served in the military
406460.0;412480.0;no i have not;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
412730.0;415510.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
415670.0;418780.0;yes;how long ago were you diagnosed
419280.0;426990.0;i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago ;you were very young weren't you
427600.0;430780.0;yes;what got you to seek help
431800.0;459920.0;um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help;do you still go to therapy now
460710.0;472830.0;i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks ;that sucks
473450.0;477610.0;<laughter>;do you feel like therapy's useful
478720.0;494090.0;uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back;yeah how have you been feeling lately
495320.0;539010.0;lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california ;yeah that sounds really hard how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
540250.0;566000.0;almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep;okay what are you like when you don't sleep well
567780.0;597850.0;um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile;i see when was the last time that happened
600190.0;616590.0;probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens  ;okay when was the last time you felt really happy
618720.0;655850.0;uh <makes sound with mouth> really happy i mean um i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life;that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities
657300.0;683480.0;i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn ;okay what's one of your most memorable experiences
686140.0;710200.0;uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this ;wow

109480.0;117860.0;oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies ;how did you decide to do that 
119550.0;137690.0;well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film;that's great 
138440.0;140310.0;<laughter> ;when was the last time that happened 
141180.0;147020.0;last time i made a film just this last october made a short film ;what was it about
147540.0;164900.0;<laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally;mhm that sounds interesting 
166710.0;171130.0;thanks <laughter> ;what are some things that make you really mad 
172010.0;196790.0;really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad ;uh oh 
197450.0;198890.0;yeah ;that sucks 
198900.0;207260.0;<laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school ;do you find it easy to be a parent 
208350.0;237920.0;no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  ;yeah  what's the hardest thing about being a parent 
240350.0;286440.0;<sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   ;uh huh that sounds really hard 
287510.0;312140.0;mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it ;that's good what's the best thing about being a parent 
312350.0;316200.0;<sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they ;aw
316310.0;331760.0;yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but;<laughter> 
331380.0;345760.0;you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that ;yeah that's so good to hear 
346370.0;349110.0;hmm;what do you think of today's kids 
349600.0;385620.0;oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed;uh huh 
395260.0;402530.0;and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong;yeah i see what you mean 
402840.0;405260.0;hmm;what do you do when you're annoyed

569320.0;583930.0;and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist;yeah i see what you mean  what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
584810.0;608290.0;um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better ;mm why did you stop 
609180.0;620930.0;um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so ;mhm

163950.0;176520.0;and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the ;why
177500.0;195760.0;because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life;okay do you consider yourself an introvert
197180.0;223000.0;sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself;uh huh how close are you to your family
224950.0;232340.0;uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so;i'm sorry to hear that
231430.0;250450.0;but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together ;right
250310.0;257370.0;but it's somewhat close;okay what do you do to relax
259410.0;292540.0;mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever;uh huh
292300.0;300930.0;works but mostly in my free time i create things;okay do you travel a lot
302210.0;325900.0;i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel;what do you enjoy about traveling
327270.0;349160.0;seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that;uh huh
349080.0;353030.0;but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>;<laughter>
353080.0;356030.0;<laughter> <clears throat>;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
357940.0;412010.0;um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas ;uh huh
413160.0;435860.0;so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway;yeah
435900.0;442460.0;so i i like i like doing that;i see what you mean cool when was the last time that happened
443940.0;485750.0;the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so;wow
487950.0;490680.0;it was kind of an interesting;what are some things that make you really mad
492880.0;518700.0;uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate;yeah
518600.0;537150.0;or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad;uh huh okay what do you do when you're annoyed
538970.0;571670.0;when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works ;has that gotten you in trouble
572890.0;595690.0;not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if ;uh huh
604980.0;625280.0;it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it;okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
626710.0;637800.0;uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my;whatever comes to your mind
639070.0;668040.0;uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her ;yeah
672080.0;690410.0;and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process ;yeah
690450.0;743820.0;but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually;yeah
743420.0;775220.0;and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that;uh huh
782480.0;805990.0;so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate;i see that sounds really hard
807280.0;829960.0;meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on;yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
831040.0;863990.0;uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over;uh huh
863740.0;883380.0;and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  ;that's great is there anything you regret
886040.0;905060.0;i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home;yeah
906660.0;957020.0;so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having;wow
958520.0;997770.0;sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have;yeah do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
998700.0;1056540.0;oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well;mhm
1058710.0;1066440.0;is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but ;yeah
1072240.0;1083230.0;it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it;yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago
1085260.0;1125620.0;um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years;uh huh
1129890.0;1154400.0;so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   ;mhm
1157020.0;1161750.0;ten years ago <laughter>;okay have you ever served in the military
1162220.0;1165110.0;no;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
1165610.0;1168390.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
1169120.0;1192840.0;no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge>;can you give me an example of that
1194100.0;1260230.0;um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so;yeah
1261360.0;1319960.0;that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies;uh huh
1320520.0;1337950.0;i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't;yeah
1337560.0;1374420.0;they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  ;mhm
1378030.0;1406890.0;so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things ;yeah
1406650.0;1423440.0;you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two;how hard is that 
1425000.0;1455270.0;very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that ;yeah
1455380.0;1489720.0;and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done ;i see how have you been feeling lately 
1490940.0;1553190.0;uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle;that's good 
1554340.0;1575070.0;and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue ;mhm
1575130.0;1607480.0;and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it ;yes when was the last time you felt really happy 
1609020.0;1659460.0;the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened;okay  how would your best friend describe you 
1663930.0;1690190.0;i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it;what would you say are some of your best qualities 
1691830.0;1721920.0;probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter> ;uh huh that's great what are you most proud of in your life 
1723600.0;1753430.0;that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer ;uh huh
1759710.0;1779840.0;and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early ;uh oh 
1784460.0;1794410.0;she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it ;yeah
1794600.0;1825470.0;and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that ;yeah 
1825110.0;1839180.0;and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now;mhm that's so good to hear  okay i think i've asked everything i need to

617660.0;641540.0;um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so;can you tell me about that 
642020.0;677930.0;um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um ;that's so good to hear

709680.0;725770.0;um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so ;yeah 
726940.0;747730.0;um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me ;that's great
748010.0;750030.0;yeah ;is there anything you regret

777220.0;804570.0;<sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself ;yeah 
810200.0;810720.0;so if;mhm
810890.0;818920.0;had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so ;i see what you mean

824820.0;865330.0;<sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um ;mhm
867690.0;888940.0;i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad ;yeah  okay  what do you do when you're annoyed 
890610.0;915080.0;<laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore;that's good  how are you at controlling your temper
915780.0;950010.0;mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it ;okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about

252660.0;273740.0;um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all ;yeah how are you at controlling your temper

343050.0;396960.0;well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible  ;yeah  that's great  have you ever served in the military

514650.0;541140.0;mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while ;that sounds really hard 
541860.0;546380.0;uh sometimes ;do you feel like therapy's useful 
548320.0;554530.0;i do  yes it is;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep 
555930.0;564830.0;it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep;are they triggered by something 
565440.0;580790.0;i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep;mhm
580960.0;582220.0;mhm;how do you cope with them 
586150.0;600090.0;um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping ;i see 
599610.0;602990.0;it;what are you like when you don't sleep well

638470.0;656350.0;uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it ;okay  how would your best friend describe you 
658654.0;696590.0;how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them ;aw  that's great 
696750.0;699820.0;<laughter> ;is there anything you regret
701444.0;711460.0;um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff ;what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
716110.0;762030.0;to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be ;yeah 
762320.0;768990.0;yeah ;that makes sense  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed

71360.0;81640.0;um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> ;why'd you move to l_a
82710.0;94670.0;um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean  ;what'd you study at school

101090.0;104900.0;um no not at the moment ;what do you do now
106010.0;122290.0;um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law ;what's your dream job 
123590.0;141590.0;my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>;what do you do to relax 
142880.0;156850.0;to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends ;what are some things that make you really mad 
158000.0;176750.0;things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> ;what do you do when you're annoyed 
178090.0;199310.0;when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything ;how are you at controlling your temper 
200580.0;221310.0;um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it ;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
223750.0;251990.0;<sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues ;how close are you to your family 
252780.0;261540.0;i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time ;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life 
263040.0;283910.0;oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways ;what's one of your most memorable experiences 
285340.0;306250.0;oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>;do you travel a lot
307410.0;329770.0;yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool ;what do you enjoy about traveling 
331080.0;364200.0;uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool ;have you ever served in the military 
364870.0;369180.0;no i have not served in the military <laughter> ;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
369800.0;372640.0;nope;have you been diagnosed with depression 
373520.0;392690.0;no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  ;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep 
394460.0;417000.0;lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  ;what are you like when you don't sleep well 
417840.0;432230.0;i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function ;how have you been feeling lately 
433540.0;473100.0;i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
474310.0;513860.0;um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   ;when was the last time you felt really happy 
515120.0;552280.0;oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> ;how would your best friend describe you 
553340.0;581330.0;my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> ;what are you most proud of in your life 
582920.0;628380.0;um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles ;is there anything you regret 
630330.0;649040.0;oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything ;what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
651150.0;687460.0;oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do ;tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed 
688650.0;724830.0;oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun ;okay i think i've asked everything i need to

168920.0;191080.0;oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences ;whatever comes to your mind

250700.0;254300.0;mhm;what do you think of today's kids
256160.0;281240.0;oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media ;yeah i understand what do you do to relax 
283360.0;289000.0;uh go on a walk or watch television ;mhm
289750.0;295320.0;or play with my computer  and uh;what are some things that make you really mad
296780.0;321300.0;um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna ;oh 
324350.0;339950.0;uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting;can you give me an example of that 
340940.0;421590.0;uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job ;oh no
421830.0;427160.0;that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting ;how do you cope with them 
428560.0;441270.0;uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um ;that's good 
441400.0;446550.0;yeah ;how are you at controlling your temper 
448420.0;468830.0;uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that ;mhm when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about 
469480.0;498300.0;um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it;that's good 
498540.0;501940.0;yeah ;have you ever served in the military 
501970.0;505530.0;no;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
506150.0;510060.0;post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is ;mhm
510930.0;516040.0;uh no i have not;have you been diagnosed with depression 
516240.0;519430.0;yes ;how long ago were you diagnosed 
519610.0;527180.0;oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty;that's a long time 
527590.0;531230.0;yeah ;what got you to seek help 
531900.0;542360.0;um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist ;what were your symptoms 
543110.0;578690.0;um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression ;yeah  did you think you had a problem before you found out 
579950.0;586700.0;yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was ;do you still go to therapy now 
587420.0;589680.0;no;why did you stop 
590740.0;616720.0;uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days ;what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
619490.0;663050.0;um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that  ;that makes sense  mhm how have you been feeling lately 
664260.0;693030.0;i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um;yeah 
693450.0;708330.0;it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  ;uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately 
709130.0;754850.0;uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and;yeah 
760960.0;781100.0;eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that ;okay  yeah is there anything you regret 
783010.0;812960.0;oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have;hmm what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago 
813930.0;853590.0;um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time;uh huh 
853890.0;859770.0;so ;i see what you mean  what would you say are some of your best qualities 
861350.0;886110.0;um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so;cool

237617.0;266076.0;um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company;are you happy you did that
266605.0;284882.0;yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and it's very helpful;that's great
282750.0;345548.0;<laughter> well my dream job is um i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be;that sounds like a great situation
344605.0;374284.0;mm i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself;can you tell me about that
375125.0;385227.0;oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to;wow
385375.0;424178.0;yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it;okay
424500.0;457112.0;actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know;aw
457990.0;476835.0;um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
478650.0;526093.0;um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that;yeah
526565.0;531983.0;it does <laughter>;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
532915.0;587679.0;probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run;yeah
587910.0;592675.0;it is it was;tell me about your relationship with your family
593025.0;626727.0;um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old;wow
626522.0;654484.0;and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child;yeah
656100.0;677958.0;probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife;can you give me an example of that
678645.0;725114.0;uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife;yeah
726250.0;741074.0;i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life;i'm sorry
742245.0;745934.0;no not at all;have you been diagnosed with depression
746600.0;751691.0;no not really no;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
752555.0;761889.0;i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no;that's good
762357.0;768486.0;no not at all;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
769360.0;799902.0;no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that;that's great
800860.0;850666.0;the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications;that's so good to hear
852250.0;882938.0;well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish;how do you cope with them
885105.0;912002.0;just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself;mm
914095.0;953381.0;well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day;yeah
954687.0;990820.0;what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately;uh huh
992172.0;1043042.0;probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time;yeah
1044287.0;1068827.0;it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore;mhm
1069800.0;1103536.0;um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know;uh huh
1104370.0;1164722.0;well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me;nice
1165482.0;1167357.0;and thank you;goodbye
1167627.0;1168057.0;bye;
103485.0;137123.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
137180.0;143816.0;i am;okay
144262.0;163540.0;i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today;that's good
164352.0;179301.0;i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles;really
179997.0;183470.0;yes i am;what are some things you really like about l_a
184502.0;222860.0;i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live;yeah
223167.0;226927.0;thank you;what are some things you don't really like about l_a
227317.0;263390.0;well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california;that sucks
263485.0;288535.0;it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of;mm
288627.0;308394.0;so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state;mhm
307909.0;323086.0;i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served;like what
323789.0;325644.0;i'm sorry;like what
326269.0;371549.0;uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
371744.0;434564.0;oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school;nice
434126.0;447143.0;so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me;(laughter
447666.0;450819.0;<laughter> so that was a;what did you study at school
451421.0;474489.0;uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so;what made you decide to do that
475061.0;503933.0;uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so;mhm
504686.0;532629.0;um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past;what's your dream job
533830.0;553005.0;hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh;aw
553955.0;576552.0;you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so;yeah
576500.0;586503.0;probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
585720.0;643294.0;uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved;okay
643152.0;697426.0;oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but;that's great
698215.0;713398.0;yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the;yeah
714740.0;729247.0;i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier;how are you at controlling your temper
729965.0;770373.0;i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties;uh huh
771340.0;779804.0;so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
779830.0;826030.0;oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so;how did you feel in that moment
827705.0;872213.0;i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match;yeah
875427.0;887565.0;whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us;mhm
888647.0;900671.0;hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently;i'm sorry
900897.0;996764.0;thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so;i see
997615.0;1024971.0;um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different;uh huh
1024385.0;1047979.0;and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different;yeah
1048200.0;1065037.0;yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
1066042.0;1095512.0;um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years;why'd you decide to enlist in the military
1095677.0;1103156.0;i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies;how old were you when you joined the military
1101527.0;1118583.0;that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into;you were very young weren't you
1119022.0;1124365.0;i was but same age as everybody else that went there;did you ever see combat
1125307.0;1132318.0;uh we did nineteen eighty three;can you tell me about that
1133157.0;1149241.0;um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so;wow
1149634.0;1162645.0;that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation;why
1163171.0;1180263.0;that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit;mhm
1180946.0;1215776.0;well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana;right
1216336.0;1230020.0;grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan;what did you do after the military
1230436.0;1263215.0;uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell;how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life
1264671.0;1297247.0;um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but;mm
1297821.0;1306764.0;it was a great experience;that's good
1308351.0;1329787.0;um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well;how have you been feeling lately
1330426.0;1344502.0;i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
1345381.0;1355914.0;no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately;okay
1356716.0;1376743.0;um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling;do you feel like therapy is useful
1377236.0;1403215.0;i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it;what got you to seek help
1404141.0;1426654.0;oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger;i understand
1427026.0;1436116.0;so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that;do you still go to therapy now
1436441.0;1446651.0;uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to;okay
1446976.0;1450624.0;yeah;how has seeing a therapist affected you
1451931.0;1469781.0;i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity;yeah
1473218.0;1480333.0;to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man;uh huh
1486088.0;1516502.0;so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good;uh huh
1516635.0;1552718.0;uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day;that's great
1552545.0;1558035.0;and i looked forward to feeling the sun so;how would your best friend describe you
1559545.0;1602824.0;uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun;mhm
1602940.0;1624523.0;i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them;yeah
1631032.0;1633021.0;so that's pretty much;has that gotten you in trouble
1634287.0;1638800.0;no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully;okay
1639897.0;1642706.0;i like to think i do;is there anything you regret
1644907.0;1666153.0;uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1667537.0;1690555.0;really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices;what are you most proud of in your life
1691967.0;1720239.0;um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so i'm proud of uh that;mhm
1719997.0;1739298.0; proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

317488.0;335436.0;well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter>;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
337800.0;367892.0;scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me;that sucks
369145.0;376632.0;<laughter> yeah it does;what's something you feel guilty about
380209.0;404608.0;something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to;yeah
406792.0;408911.0;you have no idea;do you find it easy to be a parent
411324.0;447937.0;um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them;yeah
450161.0;488264.0;fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and;mhm
488391.0;515194.0;that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them;yeah
517058.0;548530.0;just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um;mm
549999.0;557353.0;i don't know;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
559366.0;592832.0;well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy;yeah
592743.0;613270.0;um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been;i see what you mean
613324.0;619582.0;yeah;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
622166.0;676557.0;well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me;okay
677074.0;680763.0;no;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
681230.0;684333.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
684962.0;688614.0;no;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
691003.0;732481.0;uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes;do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
736762.0;760953.0;a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
764840.0;800552.0;lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um;that's good
801110.0;840006.0;the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh>;uh huh
841870.0;881226.0;some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through;can you give me an example of that
883560.0;948014.0;scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff;yeah
948347.0;981913.0;<laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser;has that gotten you in trouble
985295.0;1014325.0;sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know;yeah
1019295.0;1028535.0;i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re>;why
1029960.0;1081823.0;because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess;i see
1086200.0;1153669.0;um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay;right
1155300.0;1202366.0;<laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people;uh huh
1207040.0;1247374.0;crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter>;what are you most proud of in your life
1248725.0;1293832.0;my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again;what's one of your most memorable experiences
1296005.0;1342548.0;one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall;nice

811710.0;850365.0;hmm erase from my memory uh boy that's a good one <sigh> hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father;can you tell me about that
849315.0;887759.0;maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field;wow
889080.0;1002826.0;so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year;wow
1002777.0;1020230.0;in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though;uh huh
1020477.0;1027334.0;yeah;what would you say are some of your best qualities

1109600.0;1128875.0;i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me;mm
1128985.0;1138505.0;that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on;yeah

30130.0;70112.0;<sync>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
70760.0;77571.0;yes;so how are you doing today
79865.0;95632.0;i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay;i'm sorry to hear that
97020.0;101113.0;i was born in annapolis maryland;really
100600.0;104440.0;on the east coast;why did you move to l_a
106195.0;124416.0;originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
126390.0;150927.0;it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here;how often do you go back to your hometown
152580.0;182532.0;uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often;how hard is that
185030.0;225677.0;it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard;yeah
228790.0;261967.0;depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but;okay
264450.0;298257.0;um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess;mhm
300200.0;326838.0;um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed;cool
328300.0;367684.0;um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing;mm
369870.0;408262.0;well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me;uh huh
412462.0;445581.0;it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good;yeah
449027.0;488856.0;good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
491095.0;522590.0;um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i;(laughter
523500.0;538330.0;i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument;okay
542740.0;617569.0;um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough;hmm
623310.0;680262.0;well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different;yeah
680065.0;684899.0;things being how they were;do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
690260.0;740558.0;i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there;yeah
742330.0;770040.0;well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better;that's good
773552.0;806614.0;um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um;mhm
808232.0;818526.0;i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet;are they triggered by something
820437.0;856352.0;they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it;that sucks
858222.0;861853.0;yeah;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
865192.0;925660.0;um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now;mhm
930969.0;954502.0;um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad;okay
957210.0;1013411.0;um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know;how did you feel in that moment
1019460.0;1077625.0;in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now;yeah
1081985.0;1142494.0;um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough;okay
1144520.0;1193901.0;uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming;okay
1194982.0;1202828.0;and then there's you <laughter>;(laughter
1203547.0;1207173.0;right;what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
1210987.0;1271654.0;well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing;right
1273149.0;1274869.0;yeah;how have you been feeling lately
1276704.0;1325417.0;um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge;yeah
1326109.0;1331991.0;yeah;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1341289.0;1445088.0;um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so;uh huh
1448300.0;1500929.0;um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world;mhm
1503550.0;1549736.0;oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah;awesome
1559120.0;1594723.0;um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

498631.0;531557.0;um let's see i guess sometimes you know um you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know;mhm
532951.0;590689.0;well that's a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way;uh huh
591283.0;601327.0;well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly;aw

681354.0;682759.0;<sniffle>;how have you been feeling lately
683704.0;737566.0;well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but um you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess;yeah
738569.0;775546.0;well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not;right
778544.0;805815.0;you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem like <laughter> like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs;mhm
806744.0;844402.0;i xxx it's you know it's it's probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry;yeah
844769.0;849036.0;i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with;have you been diagnosed with depression
849609.0;856793.0;no no <grumble>;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
857024.0;926462.0;man <sigh> uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know;uh huh
926494.0;995724.0;well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my <m> my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad and like things are so um rough that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um <laughter> <sigh> do things;yeah
997521.0;998672.0;<sniffle>;is there anything you regret
999971.0;1025888.0;the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh;right
1025701.0;1069705.0;i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't wanna get away from but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome;yeah
1071366.0;1114273.0;ugh <sigh> i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like;yeah
1114386.0;1129532.0;i'm pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh <sigh> i don't know;okay
1130591.0;1239251.0;oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends but it's the same time i i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just;mm

825690.0;858885.0;um just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know the only thing you can't um i don't know you can't you know go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going yeah <laughter>;yeah
859800.0;893606.0;um i don't know um that's pretty huh most proud of i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm you know i try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can;how hard is that
894260.0;923785.0;very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know;mhm

958730.0;961487.0;yeah;tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
962250.0;1001060.0;um <laughter> my ideal weekend usually i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you know sometimes if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat;that's so good to hear
1001640.0;1004222.0;yeah;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

1006860.0;1009017.0;thank you you're welcome <laughter>;goodbye
1009350.0;1009620.0;bye;
15610.0;60477.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
60970.0;66443.0;yeah;okay
67000.0;76096.0;i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you;that's good
76960.0;81849.0;uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley;really
82890.0;86082.0;yeah;what are some things you really like about l_a
87950.0;118899.0;uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too;cool
119000.0;151185.0;<laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine;uh huh
152420.0;188585.0;wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun;what do you enjoy about traveling
190440.0;221525.0;well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um;yeah
221090.0;227767.0;so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
230060.0;263574.0;uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age;yeah
263210.0;325262.0;so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it;awesome
327120.0;390854.0;uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax;uh huh
393060.0;420643.0;i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
423620.0;463956.0;the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing;okay
465940.0;525192.0;something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true;i see what you mean
529310.0;604030.0;um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened;yeah
604960.0;615450.0;it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck;okay
617140.0;654941.0;well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven;mhm
654810.0;666270.0;and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later;yeah
668050.0;692244.0;i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
694240.0;714201.0;no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening;okay
714560.0;717258.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
717560.0;720325.0;no;is there anything you regret
722600.0;759719.0;well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
763300.0;831529.0;i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place;mm
835460.0;880991.0;um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should;when was the last time that happened
883040.0;962209.0;uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh>;yeah
966640.0;1019247.0;mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun;nice
1020890.0;1028112.0;uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we;aw
1035630.0;1059292.0;we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah;that's so good to hear
1060810.0;1062855.0;yeah thank you <laughter>;how would your best friend describe you
1065080.0;1088783.0;uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh;(laughter
1089960.0;1115021.0;i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans;mhm
1118110.0;1171224.0;mm uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um hmm <tisk> well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that;mhm

239790.0;246093.0;mhm;do you find it easy to be a parent
249390.0;269893.0;um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>;yeah
270160.0;273808.0;so;how do you cope with them
275250.0;278314.0;how do i cope <deep breath>;yeah
279090.0;302810.0;um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem;mm
305660.0;322027.0;it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face;can you give me an example of that
324550.0;350428.0;um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so;(laughter
352850.0;367163.0;yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter>;okay
368230.0;400833.0;the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>;that sounds really hard
401100.0;405443.0;yeah;do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself
406700.0;416767.0;yeah <laughter> definitely;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
420980.0;462836.0;um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily;yeah
462480.0;466151.0;into a different person <laughter>;uh huh
467100.0;470655.0;so;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
472370.0;476322.0;say it again;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
476710.0;480232.0;who's someone that's a positive influence;yeah
480580.0;497368.0;um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that;okay
498280.0;511541.0;okay;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
522080.0;548529.0;well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so;uh huh
549400.0;553558.0;yeah that's about it;how are you at controlling your temper
555990.0;573689.0;<sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
576120.0;649949.0;hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm;that sucks
650130.0;656293.0;it does <laughter>;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
658150.0;706099.0;oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that;oh no
706880.0;770636.0;yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter>;right
771060.0;774597.0;yeah;how did you feel in that moment
776780.0;852910.0;um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter>;yeah
855340.0;895813.0;um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter>;hmm
896960.0;920760.0;yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing>;yeah
921600.0;964703.0;and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm;yeah
967150.0;994848.0;i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad;what got you to seek help
997610.0;1052302.0;um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard;i understand
1056580.0;1062724.0;did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what;what were your symptoms
1063350.0;1145496.0;oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying>;do you still go to therapy now
1146710.0;1152720.0;yes i do i try;do you feel like therapy is useful
1154680.0;1180959.0;do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um;that's good
1181400.0;1192869.0;yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life;mhm
1193710.0;1248925.0;um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing;that's good
1249050.0;1255676.0;with life life yeah;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1258830.0;1290240.0;everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter>;tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
1290880.0;1317709.0;my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um;uh huh

1474440.0;1476097.0;okay;goodbye
1476550.0;1486939.0;goodbye press the buzzer now;yes
21360.0;63655.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
64190.0;69465.0;yes;okay
70060.0;75171.0;uh doing okay doing okay;that's good
75650.0;78692.0;uh north carolina;really
80170.0;81482.0;yep;when did you move to l_a
82060.0;89083.0;uh almost four years ago;wow
89650.0;100963.0;um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since;cool
101960.0;104268.0;yep;how often do you go back to your hometown
104730.0;113765.0;uh probably three <th> at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there;that's good
113980.0;116346.0;mhm;how does it compare to l_a
117620.0;138508.0;um uh it's l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home;uh huh
139420.0;166632.0;uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh uh i'm able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina;what are some things you don't really like about l_a
167740.0;206169.0;uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography;yeah
205050.0;212440.0;uh <laughter> <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production;are you still working in that
213050.0;219559.0;uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer;how did you decide to do that
220580.0;251394.0;um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now;that's great
251320.0;270405.0;i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so;awesome
270480.0;274314.0;mhm;what do you enjoy about traveling
275080.0;308549.0;uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created;mhm
310160.0;346865.0;uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world;that's so good to hear
345810.0;367667.0;i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
368570.0;398461.0;um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes;okay
404040.0;425281.0;yep <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie>;(laughter
427430.0;431689.0;<laughter> this is awkward isn't;how are you at controlling your temper
432220.0;455844.0;um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect;that's good
456700.0;497818.0;<sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word;okay
500420.0;561300.0;um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there;yeah
559370.0;581671.0;<sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh;right
583680.0;610515.0;break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory;what made you decide to do that
611010.0;640511.0;ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now;okay
641350.0;692510.0;um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so;how have you been feeling lately
693960.0;757818.0;um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee;uh huh
759860.0;805684.0;how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right;yeah
806300.0;845308.0;uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that;mhm
845680.0;874002.0;uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist;what were your symptoms
875080.0;904176.0;uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression;do you still go to therapy now
904700.0;940992.0;uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so;do you feel like therapy is useful
941320.0;966866.0;oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis;okay
968440.0;1028194.0;um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is;yeah
1029610.0;1074933.0;<psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so;right
1075110.0;1128900.0;uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so;uh huh
1131080.0;1134924.0;mm;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1135210.0;1148049.0;um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um;aw
1148940.0;1186297.0;yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right;that's so good to hear
1187590.0;1230942.0;um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have;mhm
1231700.0;1233549.0;thanks ellie;goodbye
1234500.0;1234950.0;bye;
14870.0;54857.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
55170.0;60348.0;yes;okay
61530.0;65379.0;pretty good;that's good
65940.0;68239.0;alexandria virginia;really
68490.0;71081.0;mhm;when did you move to l_a
71880.0;78266.0;uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one;that's a long time
78210.0;82857.0;yeah it's crazy <laughter>;how often do you go back to your hometown
83530.0;89925.0;um a couple times a year usually like for holidays;how does it compare to l_a
91540.0;117720.0;hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>;mhm
118350.0;125735.0;i went to um grad school at u_s_c;cool
127140.0;163223.0;um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad;uh huh
164040.0;167978.0;film;how did you decide to do that
169600.0;200554.0;hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school;that's great
201600.0;214562.0;um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>;what's your dream job
216400.0;284525.0;<sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle>;i understand
284550.0;293664.0;yeah;i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot
293160.0;309355.0;<laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount;what do you enjoy about traveling
310300.0;338282.0;um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
339310.0;409883.0;um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything;awesome
409950.0;423635.0;<sniffle>;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
420490.0;462182.0;<laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle>;okay
463760.0;473808.0;um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle>;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
477140.0;488220.0;um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>;how did you feel in that moment
489850.0;502145.0;um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting;that sucks
502980.0;508204.0;yeah <laughter>;tell me about your relationship with your family
509180.0;540710.0;um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship;that's good
541610.0;578280.0;<deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>;i see
578990.0;591881.0;<deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good;why
592340.0;623236.0;i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know;are they triggered by something
624460.0;641642.0;not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle>;what are you like when you don't sleep well
642180.0;658215.0;cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle>;i understand
659980.0;666785.0;um not really no;have you been diagnosed with depression
667240.0;670284.0;yes;how long ago were you diagnosed
670580.0;689162.0;<deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle>;what got you to seek help
690740.0;701299.0;um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle>;what were your symptoms
702840.0;736794.0;um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally;that sounds really hard
737900.0;739617.0; yeah;do you still go to therapy now
739764.0;743170.0;yes;do you feel like therapy is useful
744794.0;753632.0;yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so;what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
755194.0;814939.0;<deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>;okay
814634.0;853283.0;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family;can you tell me about that
852300.0;902428.0;yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace;aw
902830.0;905581.0;<laughter>;that's so good to hear
906700.0;908671.0;<laughter>;how would your best friend describe you
910660.0;947680.0;um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>;okay
949220.0;1101227.0;<deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so;oh no
1101340.0;1144296.0;yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>;yeah
1144990.0;1179869.0;<deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle>;that's great
1180860.0;1222757.0;<laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>;mm
1223870.0;1254441.0;hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships;okay i think i have asked everything i need to
1254880.0;1256456.0;you're welcome;goodbye

87090.0;95947.0;um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>;how often do you go back to your hometown
96550.0;104580.0;um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas;how does it compare to l_a
105710.0;125861.0;um l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street;uh huh
127530.0;128933.0;so the;i see what you mean
129160.0;134217.0;yeah;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
135100.0;154989.0;um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses;that's good
155930.0;179190.0;um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy;nice
179468.0;182923.0;no not at all;why
183517.0;202496.0;um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately um overseas;okay
203357.0;217046.0;um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out <sniffle>;i'm sorry to hear that
217842.0;225955.0;oh that's alright;i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job
223863.0;240868.0;gah um i don't have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>;mhm
241340.0;248191.0;so;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
247380.0;278950.0;um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
276626.0;293559.0;yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book;how are you at controlling your temper
294221.0;307789.0;um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
307971.0;330000.0;uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself;yeah
328599.0;358725.0;so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so;okay
359405.0;375404.0;um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently;is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this
376014.0;381894.0;um it upsets <ups> it's upsets me so;i'm sorry
382489.0;388662.0;it's okay;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
389510.0;404972.0;um let me see <deep breath> uh <sigh> i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>;okay
404970.0;409613.0;<sniffle>;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
409970.0;422018.0;that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired;yeah
421715.0;438240.0;but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't uh i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep;are they triggered by something
439771.0;454045.0;um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it;that sounds really hard
455811.0;474212.0;uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so;uh huh
475100.0;485231.0;i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter> i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee;(laughter
484855.0;493072.0;yeah so other than that i'm i'm okay;how have you been feeling lately
493690.0;535472.0;um well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened;that's good
537373.0;559325.0;um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day;i see
559715.0;568220.0;yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis;how long ago were you diagnosed
568531.0;584802.0;oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine;what got you to seek help
586119.0;616840.0;um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so;is going to a therapist helping you
618026.0;657487.0;um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions;yeah
658189.0;663861.0;so;i understand
664984.0;707855.0;um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so;okay
708115.0;725973.0;um uh <sigh> i would say when my son was born years ago;do you find it easy to be a parent
726921.0;736778.0;i'm not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well;i'm sorry to hear that

773642.0;806458.0;oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done;right
809561.0;833383.0;um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion that's all;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself

99760.0;115054.0;<laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter>;(laughter
116790.0;158119.0;um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so;uh huh
158516.0;162937.0;so i gave it a shot and here i am;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
163139.0;201893.0;oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so;yeah
195983.0;216550.0;<sigh> <laughter> i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um i was in morocco and i was in costa rica um i've spent some time in mexico so yeah;what do you enjoy about traveling
217563.0;234499.0;um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
235881.0;264683.0;um sure well i guess hmm i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun;what's one of your most memorable experiences
266455.0;310326.0;um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible;awesome
311065.0;313255.0;yeah;what did you study at school
314417.0;323993.0;um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies;are you still working in that
325420.0;358948.0;no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach;yeah
361040.0;371117.0;um to guess i'm not clear on the question um;let's come back to that later
371130.0;378326.0;okay;i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job
376140.0;407114.0;<laughter> wow um <sigh> you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and um really contributing to people;okay
408770.0;450494.0;um my relationship's pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and we've been we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so;that's good
453525.0;487353.0;um <mutters> well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah;mhm
486640.0;501361.0;i'm shy;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
494640.0;551004.0;<laughter> <laughter> um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so;uh huh
550580.0;555357.0;yeah yeah;how are you at controlling your temper
556695.0;565617.0;um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
567070.0;582719.0;um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so;can you tell me about that
584270.0;641870.0;yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didn't show up and uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated;yeah
642490.0;746061.0;oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and i'm in a coaching program and it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone who's not my coach and uh that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know so yeah i wasn't um i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i could've certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would've made the call go a lot smoother;uh huh
747810.0;800349.0;hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging;what made you decide to do that
802057.0;858012.0;oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move;that sounds like a great situation
859728.0;863072.0;yeah;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
864377.0;907293.0;uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh> relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily;are they triggered by something
909236.0;941838.0;um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah;how hard is that
943051.0;959440.0;um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation;i see
960802.0;985943.0;um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy;i'm sorry
986379.0;990172.0;<laughter> thanks;have you been diagnosed with depression
991029.0;995049.0;i have in the past yeah;how long ago were you diagnosed
995373.0;1003043.0;oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago;what got you to seek help
1004191.0;1009189.0;i was suicidal;do you feel down
1010573.0;1014751.0;oh yeah i feel down mhm;do you still go to therapy now
1015437.0;1018192.0;i don't actually no;why did you stop
1020205.0;1052085.0;um well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and um and then i began therapy again later on think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so;do you feel like therapy is useful
1053333.0;1063720.0;yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous;right
1064093.0;1100141.0;i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever;yeah
1099173.0;1136125.0;<deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow huh wow that's pretty sad um it was at least a year ago no i that's not true it was when i um saw my biological mother which was last may;what would you say are some of your best qualities
1137384.0;1171066.0;my best qualities um <sigh> i'm very strong very strong-willed i um am very supportive and loving and nurturing um i'm easy to be around i'm intelligent and um yeah;is there anything you regret
1172635.0;1185317.0;anything i regret i don't think so no;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago

1248956.0;1291314.0;hmm <sigh> i am most proud of um a few things i mean i've moved to places that i wanted to move to and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually um mm achieve those those um goals or those yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california;that's great

100670.0;116940.0;well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it;okay
118020.0;133739.0;uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great;mhm
134360.0;140166.0;broadcast journalism;that sounds interesting
140830.0;153068.0;well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream;are you still working in that
153420.0;155697.0;no <laughter>;why
156320.0;179734.0;well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my twenties and it just once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy;yeah
180340.0;183535.0;yep <sigh>;what's your dream job
184680.0;194288.0;my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries;nice
194950.0;205166.0;<deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them;i see what you mean
204380.0;213401.0;it;i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot
213050.0;218222.0;i used to i don't travel so much right now;what do you enjoy about traveling
218840.0;231628.0;i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like where i'm from;uh huh
232540.0;237484.0;my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday;wow
237680.0;243343.0;'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line;(laughter
244410.0;281658.0;and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world;awesome
280560.0;283108.0;more shy <sigh>;why
283670.0;319908.0;<deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um <deep breath> i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people so <sigh>;okay
319710.0;338247.0;<deep breath> i watch t_v <sigh> a lot or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax;uh huh
339300.0;348899.0;<deep breath> pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
350050.0;365641.0;<deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly <sigh>;mm

386930.0;395108.0;not sure i have one at the moment;okay
395600.0;413124.0;<deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh>;that sucks
413260.0;419213.0;yeah <sigh>;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
421080.0;468448.0;hmm <sigh> well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that;yeah
469310.0;475735.0;pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>;that's good
476810.0;497210.0;<deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out;that's good

582090.0;592870.0;<deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that i think there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret;like what
594180.0;617222.0;um <deep breath> well i just think that there are things that um <sigh> like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i don't have a lot of xxx regrets about things;okay
618320.0;634232.0;<deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff and save more money <laughter>;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
631400.0;660022.0;like <deep breath> well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um uh <sigh> think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh> be a little more bold;mhm

36730.0;58675.0;<sniffle> <sniffle> yes;okay
59680.0;66394.0;i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good;that's good
67020.0;79823.0;i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so;cool
81270.0;87775.0;it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah <clears throat>;what are some things you really like about l_a
88540.0;108701.0;some things that that i really like i would have to say you know the beach um you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah <clears throat>;yeah
108900.0;117037.0;right yep;i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot
117180.0;143722.0;yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth> um you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so;mhm
143830.0;146331.0;yep <clears throat>;what do you enjoy about traveling
147020.0;160759.0;um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so;yeah
163080.0;165545.0;<clears throat>;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
166320.0;183301.0;well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so <clears throat>;nice
184060.0;186505.0;yep;what's one of your most memorable experiences
187470.0;204323.0;um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so <clears throat>;mhm
203190.0;213355.0;yeah i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months <clears throat>;that's great
213880.0;216414.0;yep;how did you decide to do that
217110.0;246554.0;well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories;yeah
246100.0;252122.0;i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so;uh huh
252490.0;260434.0;yep;i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job
258260.0;280023.0;<laughter> my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so <clears throat>;okay
280570.0;310021.0;my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said i'm twenty three years old um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well <clears throat>;that's good
309660.0;341342.0;you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and;mhm
341310.0;354641.0;so <clears throat>;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
352150.0;376633.0;<laughter> um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so;mm
376790.0;379926.0;<clears throat>;how are you at controlling your temper
381000.0;406555.0;you know i've actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
407180.0;428042.0;well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so miniscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances;uh huh
427580.0;433502.0;<clears throat> yeah;what's something you feel guilty about
434570.0;458050.0;something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice <clears throat>;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
458960.0;499318.0;hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah <clears throat>;yeah
500410.0;508595.0;yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old;aw
507920.0;524086.0;so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i don't i don't  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah <clears throat>;okay
525160.0;553822.0;my best friend <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah;mhm
554350.0;557452.0;<clears throat;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
558300.0;583454.0;you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>;okay
584330.0;608120.0;lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>;that sounds like a great situation
608230.0;616712.0;yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part;right
616450.0;619559.0;<clears throat>;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
619980.0;623066.0;i have not no;have you been diagnosed with depression
623440.0;627642.0;nope;do you feel down
627970.0;633141.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
633410.0;660457.0;last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so <clears throat>;how did you feel in that moment
661680.0;681367.0;i felt great you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah;yeah
680900.0;683996.0;<clears throat>;is there anything you regret
685370.0;722463.0;yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way <clears throat>;yeah
723310.0;753062.0;<laughter> well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just be careful you know make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be um basically you know just always be nice be honest um just be caring toward others so <clears throat>;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
754400.0;775168.0;um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so <clears throat> yeah;okay
775820.0;802177.0;my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends um either you know we hang out in the day you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so <clears throat>;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
802760.0;827991.0;some things that i wish i could change um probably just you know be nicer like i said before um maybe not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life but i know there are times when i i kinda get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so;mhm
827750.0;834599.0;<clears throat>;tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself
834890.0;866954.0;um well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so <clears throat>;okay
867260.0;892605.0;my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined i'm very caring now more than i used to be very honest and you know i i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh <clears throat>;that's good
889470.0;919744.0;<clears throat> something that i did recently that i really enjoyed um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that so;awesome
919100.0;922529.0;makes me feel good yep <clears throat>;what was it about
923490.0;940514.0;um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah <clears throat>;what are you most proud of in your life

183010.0;200367.0;i can't see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything;what do you enjoy about traveling
202150.0;239089.0;i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing;uh huh
240020.0;244561.0;mhm;i see what you mean
247010.0;256451.0;uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie;(laughter
257290.0;327376.0;um let's see uh well um i it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal;yeah
331250.0;374779.0;hmm it's a tough question um one <on> um <makes clicking sound with mouth> i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that;yes
375280.0;380337.0;yeah come back to it;let's come back to that later
380830.0;384325.0;yeah that's what i just said;what did you study at school
385000.0;388808.0;film;how did you decide to do that
390175.0;467607.0;you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like;hmm
467890.0;486700.0;um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck;uh huh
486460.0;494407.0;and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so;(laughter
494950.0;515660.0;i'm not really sure uh yeah it's it's it's um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but uh i've always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general;are you still working in that
516160.0;524786.0;i am yes;i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job
528036.0;555825.0;um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put <pu> put together and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but;mm
555938.0;565049.0;i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing;okay
566890.0;629142.0;well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them um my i guess um it's funny you should ask ellie um i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't when away like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean <mea> and my family in general;mhm
629572.0;652230.0;well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like um i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um;why
653709.0;689240.0;i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it;okay
691363.0;729356.0;um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking;yeah
731190.0;736161.0;pretty good;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
736571.0;764702.0;well i always like arguing um i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject;uh huh
764363.0;784978.0;um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question;yes
787236.0;794612.0;um;when was the last time that happened
795372.0;800976.0;what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate;uh huh
802581.0;838191.0;hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie;why
838654.0;923449.0;um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like;mm
927430.0;955194.0;in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained;yeah
954820.0;975793.0;and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is;right
975730.0;1022269.0;and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else;hmm
1022060.0;1068781.0;um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor;yeah
1068450.0;1129250.0;in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort;i understand
1129220.0;1137322.0;yeah i'm glad you understand <deep breath>;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
1139970.0;1165692.0;an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so;hmm
1165530.0;1171526.0;yeah;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
1172400.0;1181711.0;the hardest decision i've ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions;yeah
1189220.0;1220482.0;hmm um like choosing between two things that it's like i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um;mhm
1227990.0;1277619.0;and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york;i see
1280300.0;1283844.0;it was how hard was that or how hard is;yes
1284620.0;1341600.0;how hard was that um it was hard <laughter> um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating <is> 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etcetera;yeah
1342540.0;1346332.0;yeah;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
1347290.0;1390779.0;well recently it's been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i i don't know;mm
1392380.0;1431145.0;tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go um without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess;okay
1430910.0;1436118.0;more introverted;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
1437990.0;1443062.0;since like lately as in when;whatever comes to your mind
1445190.0;1513081.0;um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just you know you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>;that's good
1513570.0;1516521.0;no i just;have you been diagnosed with depression
1518410.0;1522847.0;nope;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1527680.0;1601346.0;the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like;wow
1607290.0;1610388.0;you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't;uh huh
1616475.0;1623955.0;it's too much else to do so;that makes sense
1630550.0;1680816.0;i would say that i'm very accepting <acce> like accepting of other people and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um and open <o> open <ope> like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um;okay
1687140.0;1740616.0;hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um <sigh> yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself i'd i would i don't know <laughter>;um
1741780.0;1824641.0;hmm really badly about myself um <sigh> i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like there's no yeah i don't know;that sounds really hard
1825800.0;1830910.0;yeah;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1834290.0;1885436.0;ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that there's um i have a tendency to like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums;mhm
1886670.0;1918089.0;would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i um i don't know i guess stay uh don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

208780.0;218073.0;i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives;what's your dream job
218560.0;226611.0;oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>;(laughter
226430.0;238178.0;but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals;yeah
238290.0;246719.0;so;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
245600.0;272448.0;i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
265330.0;289516.0;<laughter> <laughter> <laughter> oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things <laughter> so;how are you at controlling your temper
289810.0;309880.0;i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so;mhm
307230.0;325693.0;mhm mm i can't really remember so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so;okay
326930.0;335662.0;i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
335350.0;347131.0;mm i can't think of anything right now;hmm
349410.0;376513.0;i really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider;that makes sense
376110.0;381628.0;mm yeah;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
382270.0;406576.0;an event hmm well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more;yeah
406410.0;417031.0;but you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with that so;there are always trade-offs in life aren't there
415780.0;428176.0;mhm yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives;mhm
427710.0;432219.0;so;tell me about your relationship with your family
432570.0;454385.0;well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so;that's good
455300.0;457932.0;mhm we have a small family;what do you think of today's kids
458680.0;487730.0;uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very well-behaved so can't say much else about that;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
488290.0;520679.0;well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't;oh no
520660.0;558147.0;yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter> but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's i can't say anything to her about that;that sucks
557560.0;580875.0;so yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so;what are you like when you don't sleep well
581850.0;608364.0;tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep;uh huh
608440.0;611909.0;mhm;how have you been feeling lately
613090.0;630503.0;uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that;right
631090.0;655460.0;i um i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so;okay
655830.0;658985.0;no mm mm;have you been diagnosed with depression
659060.0;665308.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
665460.0;679801.0;i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so;tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
680600.0;698548.0;hmm <laughter> can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so;okay
699440.0;705545.0;no i never regret anything;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
702990.0;735731.0;uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um you know seems like <laughter> uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um wasted time with certain people um i don't know those are the things that come to mind;uh huh
736860.0;742719.0;maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things;okay
742260.0;746220.0;but mm;how would your best friend describe you
747650.0;762739.0;outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so;that's good
763070.0;767732.0;mhm;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
768100.0;792172.0;well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so;yeah
791900.0;802222.0;that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah;i understand
802190.0;806368.0;mhm;how would your best friend describe you
807270.0;810625.0;i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>;yes
811890.0;820430.0;but uh if you want i'll repeat it so;what would you say are some of your best qualities
820900.0;850103.0;um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so;mhm
850670.0;867184.0;hmm that's a hard question <laughter> the can't think i mean i'm can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>;what are some things you like to do for fun
867710.0;892895.0;for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um that's kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so;what do you enjoy about traveling
893470.0;911367.0;traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place;yeah
911670.0;914281.0;mhm;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
915010.0;948629.0;okay well <laughter> i've um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international;mm
958810.0;974948.0;and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so;wow
975050.0;978871.0;uh;that sounds like a great situation
979330.0;1005869.0;yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um so yeah that's mhm;right

209670.0;235812.0;mm um well with my ex i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out;yeah

254920.0;265326.0;um having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer;tell me about that
266750.0;291131.0;um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible;yeah
291970.0;326603.0;uh me and my family aren't very close we don't i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close connection <collection> connection <con> connection um especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from having been grown up out in america so it's pretty different when it comes to those cultural <cu> racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but it's okay;okay
328160.0;356443.0;i think they are out of control i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost;yeah
357410.0;367198.0;um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby;what are you like when you don't sleep well
368450.0;389415.0;um usually creative actually when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that;okay
390810.0;407485.0;um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energized and i'm live then some nights some days where i'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my live self;why

387070.0;408462.0;okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters and my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and;(laughter
410000.0;436866.0;and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship um and then there's the husband which i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter> we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah;okay
437220.0;463866.0;yeah so that that's not good the the relationship with the husband but um but since we have determined that we need to divorce our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good;yeah
466000.0;490964.0;hm well i guess our marriage i wish i had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what i thought it was;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
492200.0;508470.0;um <sigh> let's see oh my god hardest decision i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard;can you tell me about that
510690.0;605456.0;um well you know we were married and i wasn't content i guess you could say um and i kinda just gave up on our relationship and i i now that i look back i think it's because i wanted children and he would've been happy to never have any and so uh since i didn't have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at a age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and <tisk> um <tisk> and i had to leave him because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause you know i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter> <laughter> but um it was hard to leave him;yeah
608070.0;795784.0;mm something i wish i could erase from my memory i have to think about that i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well yeah there's um i guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends um i've betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home and um we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home <tisk> and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and uh yeah that was devastating i don't think i had ever  been betrayed like that so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young and um my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say six maybe um maybe five anyway her <h> her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact <laughter> she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet i still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to to me;yeah
796070.0;805307.0;that was about what ten about eight years ago anyway <sigh> i tried to i tried to;i'm sorry
806337.0;818357.0;ignore it and put it out of my head and which i've been able to <sniff> in recent years but obviously it still comes up;yeah
819020.0;825085.0;anyway that that was that;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
826800.0;850994.0;<sniff> um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing;are they triggered by something
853662.0;898389.0;well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter> and then um <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom so i guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to i guess;okay
901662.0;935149.0;um well i'm kinda used to it now so i just go on through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch t_v watch whatever;mhm
938627.0;953434.0;lately how have i been feeling um kind of down on myself down on life;can you tell me about that
956848.0;1043118.0;well i have this pending need <n> need for separation slash divorce um <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood <clears throat> and so i worry that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late um like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things uh and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life i know i wanna do something i i i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff so i i regret that extremely and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter> um that's the state part of the state of my life;okay
1043755.0;1046404.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
1047197.0;1050206.0;yes;how long ago were you diagnosed
1052523.0;1059471.0;mm <tisk> well the first time or or or recently;yes
1061604.0;1149671.0;the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then i was um <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling i was really upset how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know um yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about two years ago;mm
1150697.0;1152939.0;no;why did you stop
1155302.0;1172422.0;um money i i don't have insurance otherwise yeah i'd be happy to go to therapy <laughter> anything that might help;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
1175209.0;1196904.0;ooh <laughter> boy last time i felt really happy um i don't know i guess maybe when my children were born that's;how did you feel in that moment
1198197.0;1229044.0;<laughter> um i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know i always wanted children so it was nice to have them that's i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times;yeah
1230825.0;1273719.0;<sniff> mm something i did that i really enjoyed well let's see i um friday night i went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun;that sounds like a great situation
1274569.0;1279181.0;yeah we get to;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1281697.0;1395430.0;ooh <sigh> stay in college get my degree um get therapy try to become a happy um yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life having no money is you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it um don't quit to go traveling you know just stick with a job stick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field yeah that would've been my biggest piece of advice to myself;okay
1397093.0;1446117.0;not much <laughter> i guess just my daughters you know they're beautiful daughters and i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but um i'm i guess that's the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters;what would you say are some of your best qualities
1448337.0;1521098.0;um i'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal um very <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly and caring and um yeah i care about people and i'm interested in people and i care about animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian i'm a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured and live a a tortuous life just so we can eat 'em;yeah
1520930.0;1531245.0;so um what was the question do you remember the question;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

18100.0;62749.0;<sync>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
63450.0;68605.0;yes;okay
69140.0;99808.0;<clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh i slept all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school i only have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today;okay
100600.0;104930.0;i'm originally from bakersfield california;really
105660.0;108539.0;really;when did you move to l_a
109720.0;123935.0;uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and i've been move i moved back here in oh seven and i've been living here um ever since;how often do you go back to your hometown
125310.0;147330.0;um wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat> maybe like a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here unfortunately;how does it compare to l_a
148280.0;196834.0;uh <sigh> uh <laughter> uh it compares to l_a um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um l_a has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so <s> um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with;yeah
197070.0;212668.0;oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so;okay
213780.0;257780.0;um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> <lip smacking> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so;wow
258690.0;285156.0;but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere;what made you decide to do that
286480.0;289181.0;to be an optician;yes
289820.0;332402.0;oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician;that makes sense
331540.0;352604.0;and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it um and it's it's fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with;that's great
354710.0;359830.0;cool;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
359190.0;370804.0;uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon;(laughter
369940.0;387400.0;or uh animated or whatever <laughter> so cool but no usually ninety eight percent;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
385380.0;439003.0;<laughter> um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh;hmm
439330.0;466692.0;yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didn't go i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the cold season so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>;okay
468330.0;514180.0;um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of 'em were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
514180.0;534699.0;oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so;mm
535050.0;540472.0;we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
541530.0;623409.0;uh um i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um handled differently there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbed_entry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because <clears throat> i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so;yeah
624380.0;629253.0;you know;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
632510.0;719813.0;mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i don't really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so;mm

105190.0;130601.0;uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag and um i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall it's okay;okay
131900.0;141713.0;uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>;yeah

146380.0;191276.0;um i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um the problem;mhm
190230.0;198777.0;mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time;why
199460.0;221000.0;um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di> uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to;what's your dream job
221930.0;257614.0;wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i don't wanna too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job;yeah
257920.0;259544.0;yeah <laughter>;i see what you mean
259670.0;266447.0;yeah;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
265660.0;289050.0;oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of <laughter> open up too much so i have to like back off you know;(laughter
288550.0;305834.0;but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor;okay
298740.0;344563.0;oh really <laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> oh um well i listen to music um i'll um well i watch t_v um i'll um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too i'll be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances;mm
345390.0;363501.0;um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going;that's good
363870.0;367775.0;yeah;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
369100.0;392593.0;wow that's a good question um i'm not sure to be honest um i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that it's not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head;okay
393380.0;446789.0;well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret;i see
447720.0;461627.0;wow hmm that's a tough one i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>;okay
461790.0;465839.0;okay;tell me about your relationship with your family
465830.0;517949.0;oh well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay but um uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in;okay
519100.0;547469.0;um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a long story short <laughter> um it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult;how have you been feeling lately
548970.0;572346.0;uh <sigh> well i've been feeling okay i mean um i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late;that's good
572950.0;575377.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
576070.0;585973.0;well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h;mhm
585580.0;614096.0;the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression;why
615170.0;657522.0;well you know um like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh i'm doing okay but i you know i kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to;okay
657320.0;713074.0;wow that's a good one <laughter> really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth> okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago;that sounds like a great situation
713250.0;716969.0;yeah yeah it was;how would your best friend describe you
718570.0;738562.0;best friend i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>;what would you say are some of your best qualities
739640.0;768108.0;um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part;mhm
770150.0;777421.0;um what do i regret well can you elaborate that <laughter>;whatever comes to your mind
777810.0;817345.0;uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all;mm
819790.0;845615.0;well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example i'd make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been well off for the rest of my life <laughter>;yeah
845320.0;871126.0;but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret;right
871800.0;875947.0;yeah;tell me how you spend your ideal weekend
876930.0;915503.0;wow that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter> <laughter> well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know i'd like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends;mhm
916380.0;955374.0;uh that's interesting most proud of um i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad bad uh vice um you know i i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably i don't know if it's really proud um but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak;okay i think i have asked everything i need to
955790.0;957902.0;okay;thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
958420.0;959820.0;my pleasure;goodbye
960210.0;1004220.0;bye now          ;
30580.0;77935.0;<sync>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
77930.0;82988.0;yes;okay
83550.0;93124.0;uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday;aw
93690.0;95889.0;california;really
96050.0;99439.0;yes;what are some things you really like about l_a
100090.0;105075.0;um the beach;mhm
106160.0;108893.0;i love the waters;what are some things you don't really like about l_a
109510.0;116000.0;the gang violence violence;okay
116920.0;128771.0;um i lost a lot of friends growing up in um through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence;i'm sorry to hear that
130590.0;145073.0;yeah thank you it was pretty tough out there <laughter>;yeah
144970.0;157918.0;um haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really;okay
158740.0;168990.0;um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician and i also have my associate's degree;that sounds interesting
169800.0;199837.0;um actually i went in i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats;what's your dream job
201620.0;205701.0;to be a optometrist;why
206640.0;241414.0;um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step and um what i why is a good question it's because then i would have a be able to have my own business and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a a family business but a a to help the community as well and something i could leave for my daughter;that makes sense
242100.0;270919.0;uh my daughter she's five years old uh she'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um she's adorable she's my heart;do you find it easy to be a parent
271230.0;278171.0;no this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>;what's the hardest thing about being a parent
276240.0;340229.0;it's very hard providing providing uh making sure that you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and i'm a little more mature than her father so it's um it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so complicated let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to make sure that she has a good day so it's all about uh going the extra mile doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job;yeah
342280.0;384494.0;um that moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you and um my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and how many i mean just call your name it just it's a sense of reality um to be called mom or to call call dad and it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent;that's so good to hear
385990.0;390506.0;thank you;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
391530.0;430631.0;um a lot of different things i'm actually taking care of my daughter <laughter> um i'm here with her uh i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and my father i mean i couldn't point him out on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so i feel that um i'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up;yeah
432030.0;435347.0;yeah;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
436880.0;505595.0;um i guess i there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in the uh she's an l_v_a and um she's one of my older sisters um i can say me believing in god being in my life god being in my life has also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and um hm i don't know i don't really look up to a lot of different people because people lie so and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me;okay
504690.0;541322.0;i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy um coming up as a kid and i don't know i don't know what happened to me uh one day i just broke out of my shell and i've been um very accurate of showing my personality off <laughter>;(laughter
541750.0;572508.0;um i actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there and just zone out everybody else that's there and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing;mm
573770.0;617695.0;um <yawning> excuse me sorry about that um i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper is showing that i'm in charge of my life so i don't even let stuff get to me i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the  the negativity;that's good
618020.0;640626.0;mm probably my husband <yawning> my daughter's father um uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh physical altercation like with another human being no;okay
644090.0;693161.0;wow um being honest i kind of feel guilty about how things like uh basically how things ended um before my mom passed i wish that i could've helped her a little more even though people tell me not to feel bad um because she wasn't really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i could've been for her before she passed away so i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for;okay
695920.0;711022.0;um going through my mom passing away;how did you feel in that moment
712890.0;778426.0;um i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um basically that it was i felt kind of robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um i don't know it was nerve wracking because i felt robbed you know it was like i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now so;yeah
781110.0;807468.0;um signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared um really didn't know what to do how to take it and i mean like that was so scary;what made you decide to do that
808490.0;814463.0;um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world;are you happy you did that
814950.0;821351.0;yes;that's good
822080.0;850637.0;it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um uh i i kind of tend to try to do everything and i have to get back to that stage where i have to think about myself as well and give myself time;mhm
851970.0;868292.0;um a little like this but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter> um just groggy;okay
871320.0;892867.0;um <yawning> lately i've been feeling very confident about um being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent;that's great
893780.0;908813.0;uh <yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me but i don't no more;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d

21420.0;59451.0;<sync>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
59480.0;64249.0;sure;okay
64590.0;68450.0;pretty good;that's good
69190.0;73499.0;new york;really
74680.0;79863.0;uh i moved to l_a in the seventies;that's a long time
78780.0;84989.0;but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places;how often do you go back to your hometown
83120.0;101942.0;of um i guess every few years but i travel a lot so i've lived in i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too;wow
102710.0;112689.0;um different cultures food music rituals uh everything the smells the colors makes you feel alive;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
113210.0;116357.0;excuse me;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
116530.0;119029.0;one of my trips;mhm
118700.0;146339.0;uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say i love horseback riding so when you're uh viewing other animals when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great seeing red orange fall sunsets and riding along you know uh seeing so many animals yeah;what's one of your most memorable experiences
147650.0;187237.0;in kenya um probably when i went to a a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to enter a masai village for the first time uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai;(laughter
186680.0;215571.0;and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living;aw
223530.0;241463.0;getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah;that's great
241480.0;344249.0;<sigh> i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes um i believe that um usually i well i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy;yeah
344410.0;348903.0;uh pardon you said you put your fish;what do you do when you are annoyed
349590.0;353411.0;what do i do when i'm annoyed;yes
352890.0;377493.0;um <sigh> <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy;how hard is that
378870.0;414110.0;um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're put in other situations where you're forced to to um understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is;yeah
415150.0;462454.0;<sigh> let me think um <tisk> uh <sigh> last time i argued about something um god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something;can you tell me about that
461490.0;539831.0;um uh <sigh> oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them;yeah
539390.0;607903.0;and i and he said that are you aware that um <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child;right
610660.0;676419.0;and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has;yeah
676000.0;695602.0;you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated;yeah
696190.0;697442.0;especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery;i understand
702570.0;756457.0;uh the following week and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so but um <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>;yeah
757790.0;761744.0;but other than that i mean i don't;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
762850.0;784400.0;<sigh> um uh <sigh> sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when it's in terms of patience;mm
795500.0;808370.0;i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital;i'm sorry
810380.0;869033.0;mm <sigh> mm my brother uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking the his body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard mm but you know it was after a while the uh you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible;yeah
870920.0;877169.0;yeah it was mhm;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
879820.0;972928.0;hm mm i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that i've had to block them i really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear and for some reason i i feel blessed that i don't really i can't really even think of something that i mean i've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me in affecting you know my behavior where i would where i block it that i'm not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really can't think of anything i mean there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to block them 'cause i've been able to you know um accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened;okay
973380.0;1027333.0;pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but say like if i'm in africa and i <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem;(laughter
1028360.0;1041851.0;okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately

1072810.0;1088817.0;um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music;is there anything you regret
1090400.0;1096281.0;regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about;whatever comes to your mind
1097630.0;1237805.0;mm you know it's funny uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been uh um opened up experiences that are that are also great that i have not overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and sometimes people sat to me like are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g> german uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life uh a different world that that would you know that i would've never um had the chance you know to live through if i had not involved my you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who you know money isn't everything and i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go;yeah
1238360.0;1286713.0;<laughter> and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision of it maybe looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya;mm
1289180.0;1327193.0;the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen um to live your life with passion and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions gut wise what will give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life;mhm
1328110.0;1356983.0;<tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and follow my passions and you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is;yeah

90440.0;96914.0;um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general;why
97670.0;116118.0;um i think that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and it's less superficial;i understand
116730.0;126577.0;<tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
127540.0;151402.0;um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally;mm
151980.0;158211.0;uh fine arts and photography;that sounds interesting
159220.0;173073.0;um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art;are you still working in that

214220.0;226155.0;um that's a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up;can you tell me about that
227410.0;253693.0;um well my family's very close um my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that;that sounds like a great situation
255010.0;272895.0;yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries;yeah
272000.0;287577.0;um i consider myself more shy;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
288600.0;298458.0;um i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted;like what
299340.0;312194.0;um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to;okay
313410.0;332938.0;um i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger;uh huh
333930.0;352060.0;um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago;can you tell me about that
353140.0;406933.0;um there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me;yeah
408460.0;412491.0;um;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
414110.0;455921.0;i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really mm like not say anything;yeah
458170.0;500693.0;um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made;okay
504060.0;537470.0;um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd wanna like have in my memory;yeah
538750.0;569668.0;um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older;mhm
570560.0;595300.0;um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer;are they triggered by something
596270.0;614585.0;no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning;hmm
615860.0;630596.0;<tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday;okay
632540.0;653807.0;um i don't know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
655170.0;678167.0;i mean nothing like lately um like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
678770.0;681743.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
682280.0;687957.0;no i have been diagnosed with anxiety;what got you to seek help
689730.0;709000.0;um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety;do you feel like therapy is useful
710580.0;727403.0;i think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah;do you still go to therapy now
728470.0;733020.0;no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid;why did you stop
734300.0;758133.0;um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasn't i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it;i see what you mean
758140.0;789292.0;<sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day;that's great
791380.0;794181.0;in general;yes
797260.0;837904.0;um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went;yeah
838500.0;846821.0;so it kind of create created more problems for me;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
846670.0;870705.0;<sigh> well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california;how would your best friend describe you
873770.0;916181.0;um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and don't really speak much;uh huh
919920.0;930200.0;um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that;nice

433700.0;448810.0;i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
453460.0;504306.0;um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the e_r and from the e_r i had the choice to i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever;can you tell me about that
506540.0;557637.0;um <exhale> it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter> so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me <laughter>;yeah
559730.0;596538.0;i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help;that sounds really hard

159340.0;167752.0;um it's a good question i'm not really sure uh there's probably;okay
169220.0;176420.0;i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>;what did you study at school

192900.0;195641.0;no;why
196110.0;203001.0;there's not much job opportunities so it's kinda limited;that sucks
203220.0;206393.0;yeah it does <laughter>;what's your dream job
207420.0;220800.0;um my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice a bar restaurant;can you tell me about that
221670.0;242069.0;well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd;uh huh
242150.0;253426.0;but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible <laughter>;yeah
252390.0;260517.0;i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but initially i'm pretty shy;okay
260550.0;273737.0;<laughter>;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
271370.0;287396.0;good idea um a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book kinda just takes your mind away;mhm
288380.0;292226.0;relax;how are you at controlling your temper
293450.0;312913.0;i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you know think before you speak that type of thing;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
313350.0;320431.0;um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago <laughter>;can you tell me about that
321170.0;349055.0;um we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate;how did you feel in that moment
349890.0;353261.0;frustrated;yeah
353210.0;373910.0;like yeah i guess everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves;uh huh
374160.0;379433.0;<tisk> but yeah;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
380430.0;414504.0;mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing;mhm
415430.0;440196.0;<tisk> um <sigh> leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that;what's something you feel guilty about
441320.0;470553.0;mm i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me;yeah
470550.0;476484.0;<tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter>;tell me about your relationship with your family
476330.0;494066.0;it's good it's very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good;that's good
494230.0;499111.0;<tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper;what are you like when you don't sleep well
499810.0;513710.0;um probably irritable there's it's harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and;mhm
514330.0;524906.0;good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well;that makes sense
525120.0;528682.0;no not at all;have you been diagnosed with depression
528870.0;534084.0;never;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
534600.0;560782.0;<tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy;mhm
561640.0;576727.0;i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less so;why
577560.0;584675.0;i don't know i i guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>;mm
584600.0;598954.0;don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something;yeah
599750.0;615166.0;um i'm just gonna stick to that argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>;okay
617350.0;647655.0;um i i don't know uh when i was when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>;how did you feel in that moment
647990.0;655312.0;stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
655790.0;664989.0;<tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends that've been positive influences;that's great
665160.0;668617.0;yeah;how would your best friend describe you
669760.0;695871.0;mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter> <laughter>;can you tell me about that
696710.0;705445.0;well i care a lot and at the same time sometimes it gets the best of me;can you give me an example of that
706330.0;726275.0;mm <tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example;i see what you mean

98950.0;125777.0;i think that it's a really important job um uh i feel like uh because there's kind of uh stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for the world <laughter>;yeah

415580.0;452196.0;um hm i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life uh because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't i mean she made like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it and um she just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence;mhm

605740.0;648463.0;um it's helpful to uh talk someone and have them kind of um guide you in talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something i mean i think sometimes you can do that on your own but uh talking to somebody helps i think;yeah

737540.0;792718.0;mm i would tell myself to uh to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like sort of lose interest and then uh not do well or as well as i could have so i would tell myself to do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more than i do and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school so i would just tell myself to do good in school probably warn myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>;mm
793330.0;858319.0;um hm um i think i am proud of myself for not being um bitter and for wanting to uh well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them i try to um or i want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

347500.0;394458.0;um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend and she actually she has kids i don't and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things um i don't think i've ever made her feel that i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it;yeah
394840.0;431650.0;um well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument;hmm
432470.0;456924.0;um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i could've just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly um instead of yelling at her too;i see what you mean

168510.0;197707.0;oh just <sigh> it um it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here um it's exciting and it makes me feel like um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day;mhm
199130.0;261722.0;well um one of my trips i went uh i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um he had <ha> he was uh uh a sales engineer or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course eh it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and um after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle;yeah
268167.0;287291.0;we went to um phuket it's a little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>;wow

320910.0;345979.0;ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and in in a veterinary capacity yeah;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
345490.0;361645.0;i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not;that makes sense
361655.0;374510.0;yeah;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
367265.0;407421.0;<laughter> <laughter> uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping um i like like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or a lotta times i can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing;uh huh
408430.0;438638.0;ah really good i don't have i would say there's certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or uh even you know yell <laughter>;that's good
437680.0;456599.0;<sigh> argued um <sigh> i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument like if we just;whatever comes to your mind
457715.0;543351.0;well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i don't know i think scrubbed_entry and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again;okay
544242.0;548706.0;but like she never she never confronted me;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
549687.0;558721.0;hardest decision <sigh> uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend;how did you decide to do that
559250.0;629443.0;uh well it wasn't <sigh> it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i don't know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did;that sounds really hard
630010.0;653215.0;it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best;that's good
651960.0;744779.0;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the <th> it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh;(laughter
748017.0;775640.0;eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter> so i would say that's one decision it it's it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed;yeah
775610.0;794140.0;<laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say <sigh> my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what you're saying;uh huh
795375.0;816456.0;mm <sigh> can't really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something;mm
820425.0;829549.0;and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't;yeah
830630.0;847180.0;<sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s> being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but i never feel rested and that's um it's a medical problem of mine;can you tell me about that

489440.0;500831.0;one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter>;could you have done anything to avoid it
500620.0;509062.0;yeah i could've stayed home <laughter>;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
511070.0;522639.0;wow i'm trying to think about a situation maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently;can you tell me about that
523560.0;568330.0;well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better;yeah
569600.0;620124.0;the hardest decision i've ever had to make the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle>;oh my gosh
620410.0;674281.0;ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience;yeah
674020.0;693804.0;yeah but i'm here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasn't finished with me yet;mhm
693810.0;721972.0;you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head;what are you like when you don't sleep well
722490.0;742196.0;um i'm sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you so;uh huh
742530.0;806124.0;lately i've been feeling really well um except i've been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately <for> fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful;yeah
806850.0;835956.0;no but i went through depression uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head so;okay
836160.0;850674.0;no only i don't go to therapy because um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability;yeah
856080.0;913595.0;so that i can get well 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle>;yeah

688375.0;739423.0;feel guilty about my grandfather um passed away in two thousand four and at that time i was just getting out of prison um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then and;yeah

833070.0;864190.0;it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep;i see what you mean
864900.0;938005.0;how i been feeling lately i just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me um making some better decisions um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes i don't care if i get five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before um the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering;that's good
937960.0;1012317.0;my behavior i'm more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh and the um acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm you know um back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you to feel the same way;okay

647660.0;659415.0;yeah but uh it all it all got resolved at the end we all <laughter> we became <beca> we were all <laughter> it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay;okay
660960.0;662397.0;yeah;is there anything you regret

816050.0;818362.0;oh you're welcome;goodbye
818770.0;819250.0;bye;
25800.0;61117.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
61860.0;67014.0;yes;okay
68070.0;73964.0;i'm doing pretty good;that's good
74750.0;82653.0;i was born and raised right here in los angeles;really
84100.0;118454.0;<sigh> um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people;yeah
119400.0;151684.0;the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think it's too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation;i see what you mean
151890.0;169566.0;i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere;that's good
171050.0;189933.0;i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city you know things like that;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
191250.0;241195.0;um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three <thr> i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back;nice
242370.0;269261.0;um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day;tell me about your kids
270130.0;328898.0;um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well;what's the best thing about being a parent
330400.0;395421.0;just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back;aw
396370.0;465358.0;um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with;yeah
466460.0;507622.0;well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably;mhm
508425.0;523493.0;um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business <laughter>;what made you decide to do that
524530.0;575686.0;i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see;what's your dream job
577340.0;635301.0;um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that;mhm
635440.0;701733.0;um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person;mhm
698010.0;766526.0;<laughter> um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like <li> also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that;okay
767750.0;818595.0;mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me;mm
818140.0;849576.0;um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it;yeah
850560.0;923222.0;um <sigh> well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two;i see
924740.0;1009473.0;probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite;okay
1011345.0;1102501.0;<sigh> mm well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest;i'm sorry to hear that
1102960.0;1106286.0;thank you;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d

1185965.0;1299455.0;well i'm really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but um i'm i'm really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well;uh huh

1358150.0;1372173.0;stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you;mhm

243530.0;279850.0;oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me;what's one of your most memorable experiences
280180.0;286794.0;um getting married and having my children <laughter>;aw
287595.0;289295.0;mm;tell me about your kids
289430.0;316004.0;i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and i've been married for thirty three years;mhm
319180.0;330152.0;and um basically uh marriage pretty strong;that's so good to hear
331880.0;392651.0;you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to 'em and find out what's going on and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law;yeah
393580.0;431180.0;uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off;that's great
432830.0;438110.0;and i i basically he treats her well;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
438740.0;507657.0;um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel so i've made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it;okay
508670.0;539501.0;i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other people's feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of;yeah
540640.0;619177.0;um <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um that i can think of that's recent;how did you feel in that moment
620310.0;661046.0;i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>;right
663640.0;671894.0;which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because;that sucks
675150.0;682035.0;it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again;yeah
681735.0;689094.0;and it didn't make any sense;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
690630.0;786739.0;um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive;yeah
787740.0;872733.0;um let me see the hardest it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything;that sounds really hard
872500.0;924301.0;yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on;that makes sense
926530.0;940917.0;and um he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call;mhm
940560.0;945499.0;and that's it;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
945855.0;951589.0;i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well pretty good;how have you been feeling lately
952110.0;967577.0;um i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental;how do you cope with them
969370.0;978430.0;um exercise walk walking more so;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
978380.0;982478.0;no not really;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
982400.0;985083.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
985250.0;989817.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
990580.0;1022442.0;i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing;that's so good to hear
1023270.0;1087692.0;oh uh resource person i've been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it;uh huh
1093950.0;1097614.0;and that gives me satisfaction;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
1098140.0;1145039.0;uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh not happy with my weight that's it yeah;mhm
1145640.0;1148124.0;i'm sorry didn't hear you;is there anything you regret
1149695.0;1169716.0;um no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1171060.0;1200362.0;um let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early;what are you most proud of in your life
1200650.0;1256316.0;most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

73870.0;90216.0;um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day;mhm

119340.0;124806.0;mm not not frequently but i have;what do you enjoy about traveling
125250.0;132408.0;meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
134450.0;175717.0;sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip;what's one of your most memorable experiences
178120.0;208557.0;um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent;wow
209720.0;214636.0;um human development;how did you decide to do that
216260.0;270741.0;um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it;that's good
271960.0;289144.0;um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry;nice
290900.0;302313.0;well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three;do you find it easy to be a parent
302760.0;308106.0;no;what's the best thing about being a parent
310820.0;322269.0;um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional;what's the hardest thing about being a parent
323780.0;331189.0;all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages;like what
334600.0;342215.0;so;yeah
344410.0;389949.0;um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way;mhm
389490.0;393650.0;tremendously;how close are you to your family
395170.0;404968.0;very close <clears throat>;that's good
404120.0;406348.0;outgoing;why
408850.0;440452.0;mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter>;uh huh
442140.0;455722.0;um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax;that's great
458260.0;489872.0;i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on;yeah
490350.0;494143.0;like exercising or something;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
496820.0;515006.0;um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him;how did you feel in that moment
517910.0;525133.0;uh really tired of talking about that same topic;can you tell me about that
527680.0;639088.0;um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting;that sounds really hard

451530.0;479052.0;yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of um recognizing that i'm upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room;how do you cope with them
479570.0;482213.0;hmm i'm sorry;how do you cope with them
482850.0;500726.0;um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner;how hard is that
501530.0;516722.0;um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling;mhm
516400.0;529980.0;why i'm being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
531980.0;590950.0;um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting i've had a very tense day um and things haven't gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there;(laughter
591230.0;604613.0;um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
608420.0;683060.0;um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasn't married um <tisk> i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but we'd only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well um i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together;aw
683140.0;714297.0;um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision;that's good
714120.0;720352.0;to marry my husband and raise our child <laughter>;yeah
721130.0;754397.0;um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license uh which i'm very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical fifteen year old;(laughter
756370.0;783694.0;and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis;nice
783950.0;819651.0;no i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills;yeah
819350.0;869516.0;that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and it's like i i'm just not that person so i i i try and be i'm i i think i am a very good mother but i'm not um a typical mother i think i'm more um i'm more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing;mhm
869980.0;894144.0;actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most;i understand
894500.0;942053.0;i'm a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading i'll read 'til midnight um and then i'll try and go to sleep um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep;how have you been feeling lately
943020.0;950993.0;yesterday i didn't feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden;yeah
953790.0;974899.0;and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy;that's good
972860.0;977510.0;so no;have you been diagnosed with depression
977730.0;982124.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
983280.0;1040834.0;um i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy;that's great
1041000.0;1078550.0;<laughter> i don't know um i think she believes that i'm uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic;uh huh
1078490.0;1094116.0;um or empathetic and uh i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver;okay
1094890.0;1133771.0;i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i i'm working on that i'm trying to get those done;okay
1135570.0;1196679.0;oh gosh <laughter> um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career;yeah
1198320.0;1240081.0;um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well;mhm
1240860.0;1289386.0;um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it um so that's that was one of my prouder experiences;that's so good to hear

215108.0;249069.0;well um i've always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh that's when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history;are you still working in that
249508.0;254894.0;i am yes it's been um fifteen years in august;wow

295227.0;321215.0;um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do;i understand
321798.0;350360.0;um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say;okay
346970.0;369306.0;<laughter> uh i meditate i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time;uh huh
370508.0;412519.0;oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot;mhm
413136.0;454352.0;oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so yeah that was it;how did you feel in that moment
455328.0;477103.0;i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time;yeah
479835.0;515248.0;uh <sigh> a situation which i wish i would've handled differently honestly i haven't had a situation like that in in years i've pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli i've kinda got that down;okay
516283.0;568640.0;the hardest decision i've ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make;how do you cope with them
569663.0;601213.0;um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom;aw
602472.0;605766.0;i do yeah;do you find it easy to be a parent
606277.0;639402.0;um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
639508.0;702249.0;oh wow so many ways um the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i don't like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because that's kind of um the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so;yeah
704025.0;710223.0;i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite;that makes sense
710661.0;713681.0;thank you;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
714110.0;746660.0;um <sigh> well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies;how have you been feeling lately
747685.0;766569.0;i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i i've been feeling really good;okay

246630.0;271226.0;i'm pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets;has that gotten you in trouble
272590.0;286475.0;uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's i don't i don't know;okay

507690.0;525892.0;thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything;how hard is that

49950.0;55210.0;yes;okay
56110.0;60935.0;doing pretty good;that's good
61280.0;76094.0;oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a californian <laughter>;cool
76430.0;80530.0;uh i'm a welder;how did you decide to do that
80900.0;100545.0;um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession;that's great
101440.0;121424.0;<sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that;i understand
121730.0;161235.0;well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better;that's good
161050.0;190365.0;it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing;mhm
183450.0;220408.0;<laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it;awesome
221210.0;249707.0;<sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child;has that gotten you in trouble
249700.0;253305.0;oh yes <laughter>;can you tell me about that
253600.0;289129.0;uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices;yeah
288690.0;342059.0;uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me;yeah
344100.0;406511.0;um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble;uh huh
411010.0;472279.0;hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly;okay
473520.0;517328.0;my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes;that's so good to hear
517090.0;521193.0;mhm;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
522230.0;576415.0;you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me;hmm
578140.0;602815.0;<sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
605110.0;693056.0;yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better;how do you cope with them
693340.0;696127.0;i'm sorry;how do you cope with them
697220.0;702987.0;i'm not understanding you i'm sorry;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
701010.0;707516.0;how <h no no i have not;have you been diagnosed with depression
707670.0;710619.0;yes;how long ago were you diagnosed
710460.0;713844.0;two thousand one;what got you to seek help
715090.0;750379.0;um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that;do you still go to therapy now
750650.0;798935.0;uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me;okay
800180.0;854862.0;<sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so;that makes sense
857880.0;918866.0;well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby;(laughter
921760.0;948833.0;and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it;mm
952450.0;1028928.0;well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>;okay
1030720.0;1069507.0;<sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
1070860.0;1131128.0;don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made;what are you most proud of in your life
1131430.0;1186337.0;my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>;okay i think i have asked everything i need to
1186520.0;1188035.0;okay;thanks for sharing your thoughts with me
1187770.0;1189734.0;well thank you;goodbye
1189770.0;1190110.0;bye bye;
12050.0;46794.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
39775.0;52357.0;okay yes i am;okay
52660.0;55186.0;i'm good thank you;that's good
55285.0;57904.0;<laughter>;where are you from originally
58210.0;62807.0;originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america;really
63830.0;66308.0;yes;what are some things you really like about l_a
67010.0;80013.0;the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to;mhm
80410.0;96027.0;traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um um that's about it;i see what you mean
93060.0;106607.0;<laughter> when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean;nice
106900.0;119598.0;the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
120050.0;144106.0;um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way;that makes sense
144680.0;148248.0;experiences on vacation or;yeah
148790.0;174951.0;um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>;(laughter
175450.0;186055.0;business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field;what's your dream job
187070.0;223011.0;my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job;yeah
221490.0;235788.0;i'm outgoing;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
228280.0;262334.0;<laughter> <laughter> that's cool <laughter> uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first;mhm
262685.0;290908.0;i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
290730.0;319970.0;actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings;how did you feel in that moment
320260.0;345700.0;when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard;mm
346400.0;408969.0;hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense;uh huh
409540.0;447778.0;woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect;that's good
448640.0;489967.0;seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me;yeah
490510.0;520992.0;it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that;what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents
521010.0;558429.0;wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
558680.0;607987.0;divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about;what made you decide to do that
608700.0;665129.0;uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return;okay
666640.0;669312.0;<laughter>;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
669700.0;711106.0;you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day;that's good
711720.0;744601.0;really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not;okay
745620.0;748278.0;<laughter>;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
748300.0;752018.0;no i haven't thank god;have you been diagnosed with depression
752230.0;756349.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
758020.0;799306.0;really happy let's see uh it's at home and i think it was when wow <mumbling> different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me;aw
799370.0;802055.0;<laughter>;that's so good to hear
802090.0;805498.0;thank you;how would your best friend describe you
806410.0;842298.0;um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with b s <laughter>;mhm
842390.0;880402.0;hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody;uh huh
882880.0;924379.0;i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys;i understand
924515.0;966927.0;hmm be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to revamp <re> don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments;what are you most proud of in your life
967285.0;1006703.0;my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary scrubbed_entry and i'm always just true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from;yeah

866073.0;885598.0;i um can go to my therapist and a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation;mhm
885218.0;896499.0;and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually;that's great
897754.0;904865.0;i believe so uh yes i was;how long ago were you diagnosed
903072.0;927831.0;i believe it was i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was looking back now what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine so four years ago;what were your symptoms
928666.0;990516.0;not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just uh just anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed and um the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so uh or so and i don't know through psychiatry and therapist and medication um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit;okay
992500.0;1028179.0;hmm about a week ago i was on a hike eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch and i laid down on the grass and took a nap and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that moment that time about a week ago;how would your best friend describe you
1029382.0;1056861.0;hmm honest sincere smart um caring um <sniffle> smart;mhm
1059041.0;1076245.0;um <sigh> good question i'd have to think about that;okay
1077815.0;1175861.0;uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out so um you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff um i probably would've gone into the military i think i was going to do that in my early twenties i'm fifty five now um i sort of regret not doing that um at that time um i regret uh selling my business i regret and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him i regret uh i regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she'd passed away i regret uh i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it um yeah i mean just here that's what i would say;yeah
1177081.0;1205077.0;stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out;mm
1205663.0;1245155.0;wow i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained genuine um i'm most proud of being who i am and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed mm who i am;that's so good to hear

1253336.0;1253785.0;bye;
10640.0;1162640.0;<sync> yes okay other than this laryngitis i have uh cleveland ohio in uh seventy nine i think it was <laughter> mhm um once a year something like that or less um uh there's a lot more to do here um they're a little more narrow minded back there and republican <laughter> um well originally show business but probably to get away from uh cleveland it was very difficult at first um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know having to uh meet new people and figure out how to make a living well i like the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness the movies um the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather um the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude the importance mhm um well not a lot but i do i just came back from vegas to visit relatives we met there and i'm going to mexico um next month um well seeing the different cultures like been to europe greece france <p> um italy um i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona i never saw sedona that was really uh an experience pure peaceful about sedona yeah well sedona's a very energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful uh pine trees and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that i had there for months so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy so it was really um very mystical in life <laughter> or in sedona in life um well being on stage in boston and um that was great i i loved doing that um um just being with friends and laughing are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically well um i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events and um i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laugh and and i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and uh gets my jokes and you know i get his and we're just um enjoying that moment um speech and drama i i majored in uh no not now i always was interested in um musical comedy when i was a child i would sing along to records in my living room and i was always in choirs in school and then when i uh went to high school i joined the drama club and i i just always had an interest and i always had a a big personality and well <laughter> um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore i'm sixty and i don't know if i have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just um relax and travel but um i i like being creative in in any way i can i like independence and i kind of have that right now so i'm okay um well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for um gosh since nineteen eighty eight and um i'm a district leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self so if i get tense or nervous i i chant um sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes <laughter> less and less though it's been happening less and less but um yeah sometimes it's got it's it's um created difficulties well i can't <c> <sigh> i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about four miles out of our way and i just i got very angry for about thirty seconds and then i had to calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but i felt kind of bad that i overreacted um you mean in my life <laughter> manys yes um gosh there's so many <laughter> i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not gonna use me on a job or something that i would take an attitude that um i'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and you know that whole uh thought process that really doesn't help the situation and i do that more often but i since i started chanting but it doesn't you know i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where i can do that um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what television to buy or something <laughter> but um um i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and um um or leaving my  comfort zone <z> place if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out til it's for you know it's they leave or something you know it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i don't make the decision and i end up suffering but longer so mhm can we move on um well uh it's hard because um i don't know if it's because i have pain in my back and neck but i i it's difficult for me to stay asleep i'd i i i don't get a um a deep sleep um but at because of uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so i have been um sleeping better because of it but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened i was um finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore i'm tired during the day and uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things or or or or not i'm sorry could you repeat that have i studied changes in my behavior uh no <laughter> i was not no mm mm oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know well i uh was going to um vegas to meet my family was my my family was flying in from cleveland to uh there we have a a relative in uh vegas and i drove with my friend and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday so we all went and had a good time in vegas i mean i was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well <laughter> uh they think i'm funny um they feel that i say it like it is um they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me 'cause i'll i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic but just <ju> that's just the way i talk so um my um the anger that sometimes wells up in me you know i just but although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you don't have those lows you don't really know what highs are so i don't i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these moments where i've just blurt out you know anger or something i just wish that would happen more less that the anger parts would happen less and they are so i guess it will <laughter> happen less um don't give up hope live in the moment and um everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear um the fact that now and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become more um compassionate person and i'm able to um uh <ss> understand people better and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect that they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy okay;

76835.0;80512.0;uh not often now not really often;why
81750.0;92984.0;uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home prior;i see
94350.0;109632.0;uh there's really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment;mhm
111000.0;124040.0;i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here;that's good
125090.0;144253.0;uh i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here;uh huh
145365.0;169690.0;uh i tend to not have things that i don't like uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like;that's so good to hear

173920.0;190632.0;uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between uh all types of people it's a very rich experience;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
192280.0;197137.0;um which one to where;whatever comes to your mind
198140.0;223189.0;uh i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that;what's one of your most memorable experiences
224870.0;261568.0;there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and let's see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too;nice
263490.0;279527.0;wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um entertainment i've studied communications i've studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman;(laughter
279345.0;282371.0;<laughter> <laughter>;how did you decide to do that
283275.0;302768.0;ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and um just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that;i see what you mean
302865.0;305368.0;mhm;what's your dream job
306980.0;329479.0;um i don't have a dream job per se what i do have is a um desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so;mm
328230.0;343807.0;uh probably more outgoing mhm;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
338930.0;370825.0;<laughter> well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform before i move uh around i get exercise so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving and uh then move forward from there;that's great
372260.0;379645.0;uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
380370.0;408267.0;argued um cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument um don't know what it's about i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money;okay
409570.0;444242.0;situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is;mhm
444450.0;449231.0;mhm;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
449875.0;506602.0;hardest decision i've ever had to make um don't really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made;okay
511390.0;535937.0;mm event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase;i understand
536500.0;543388.0;uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out;that's good
544990.0;561504.0;uh great uh a little more uh physical exertion than normal  but uh still great <laughter>;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately

645210.0;678748.0;what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago to know um to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up;mhm
679890.0;694107.0;recently really enjoyed uh uh cooked a very wonderful meal um 'cause i love cooking so that was something i really enjoyed;cool

106365.0;112574.0;uh to pursue acting and writing;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
113730.0;137033.0;mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality;mhm
138490.0;164558.0;<sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is;yeah
165530.0;182511.0;what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here;i see what you mean

248625.0;251942.0;uh in general just;yeah
253020.0;280526.0;<clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental;how did you feel in that moment

307925.0;312996.0;writing to pursue writing;what's your dream job
314670.0;322434.0;writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first;how hard is that
323340.0;342919.0;hard very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to;mm
342250.0;357820.0;i would say outgoing on in general;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
358900.0;379861.0;i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place;how are you at controlling your temper
380915.0;397899.0;i am getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm good at controlling my temper 'cause i don't usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it;has that gotten you in trouble

410590.0;446468.0;argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasn't it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly;okay
447470.0;465627.0;<sigh> hmm mm i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it;could you have done anything to avoid it
467700.0;483701.0;mm i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've made the outcome much less chaotic;i see what you mean
484970.0;526452.0;hmm uh i guess that would be hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always gonna feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good;yeah
527210.0;530431.0;yes;how did you decide to do that
531085.0;545397.0;i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just yeah;i understand
547910.0;566886.0;mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that;okay

588090.0;600071.0;my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them;how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep
601540.0;614371.0;it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy;what are you like when you don't sleep well
616120.0;640119.0;<sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off;how have you been feeling lately

702950.0;730273.0;probably as um  very funny humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just they know they know that i'm there if they need them always;uh huh
731770.0;741893.0;my drive being more driven and just getting things done;tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself
741600.0;779497.0;mm i guess it would be well a recent a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible;i see
780840.0;787471.0;yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago

430660.0;441441.0;uh i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else;why

941180.0;941690.0;bye ellie;
14640.0;926490.0;<synch> <clears throat> yes i'm doing fine thank you i'm from los angeles california yes um well the main thing i like the weather um i like the lifestyle i like um the variety of beach um snow we have it all um some things i don't like about l_a um the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous um i have i'm well-traveled um i enjoy seeing new places going new places um it's different everywhere the people are different um it's fun um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june and um while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the um the swamp tours and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday lousiana with my aunt who will be a hundred and one this year in may um there's a lot um as far as traveling or just period uh most memorable experience um well i don't know if it's just one um probably when i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips mhm um just general and also drama uh well my dream job is to become a real estate investor um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so i should have my license um sometime this year outgoing um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter> um take a bath um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways um it needs to be worked on but um i know when to control it um when i need to um well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but um that's usually how it goes <laughter> um well i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess um probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um situation i wish i would've handled differently um just kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions um it was just a lot of um a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um if the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing um i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so um i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so um well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes um something i can erase um mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems um well i would have to say my mother yes um well she's just always supported me and everything that i've done um whether it's good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing mhm um sometimes sometime it's not um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes so um that's more the problem i would like to get mhm um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap um i've been feeling fine mhm uh no they've been about the same no no um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter> um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six i really wouldn't i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom mhm so um well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else uh myself well i do wish that um at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive and um i'm just a good friend no um well uh twenty years ago um just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you <laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter> um proud of uh <sigh> mm i guess maybe myself um my kids k thank you bye;

100920.0;112104.0;<laughter> yes i've lived in paris and i've been around the world a lot;awesome
112460.0;133608.0;um uh it's just um it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to um get to experience all the fantastic um sights and and <ss> and cultures;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
134370.0;180004.0;um uh well i mean um uh i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still um i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff;yeah
180640.0;207770.0;um i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah;nice
208240.0;225208.0;um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to just to get the um just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do;what made you decide to do that
225560.0;257283.0;i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um the way the school system goes right now it um it just it it turns people into into um just um just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that;yeah
257970.0;276177.0;that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal um you know uh trajectory;how hard is that
276940.0;312433.0;um i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via any sort of um legislation except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system;okay
311680.0;327785.0;uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think um i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know;(laughter
328070.0;330254.0;<laughter> yeah;that makes sense
330070.0;343156.0;yeah;sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax
340680.0;389045.0;yeah that's cool um i definitely um uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot so that's quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and but you know and i i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too;mhm
389750.0;409314.0;um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam;has that gotten you in trouble
409540.0;428884.0;a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
428490.0;463132.0;oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out you know um sabotaged or or definitely just when uh what's the last specific time well i you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her;how did you feel in that moment
463970.0;502653.0;i felt like um i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel;i understand
507140.0;515078.0;there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but i never really feel bad for;yeah
516260.0;524779.0;being angry about what i'm angry about;okay
526110.0;574809.0;well when i was pregnant i wish i had um like i said um i i went through um such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of um undermined that um that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where um i was set to be when the child arrived that i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so;wow
574820.0;577116.0;yeah;that sounds really hard
577010.0;585136.0;it's fucked up yeah;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
585570.0;602722.0;i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i don't and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory;okay
605340.0;640362.0;um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong <laughter> um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign um sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the there is nothing wrong with me i just happen to succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just been you know um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out;what made you decide to do that
641850.0;650519.0;overcautiousness;okay
650510.0;660031.0;it's horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality intrigue and sabotage it's bad;i'm sorry

713820.0;716967.0;not so easy these days at all;why
717380.0;738267.0;um i'm being i've been um i'm not completely centered and then there's been some um actual you know uh people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that;what are you like when you don't sleep well

149680.0;183071.0;okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go the the smaller the steps get so like people back then had uh smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the the the steps but once you get up there it's a nice view i yeah;awesome
183810.0;192035.0;uh general education but um mainly art yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes;what made you decide to do that
192660.0;204061.0;um well when i was a kid i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so i just pursued it so yeah;what's your dream job
204380.0;209120.0;my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art;(laughter
209610.0;214398.0;yeah um yeah pretty simple;how hard is that
215010.0;231483.0;um it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion um persistence and faith and will you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed;mm
233130.0;238562.0;mhm;do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing
237890.0;278416.0;i consider myself to be shy in certain um time and places but i am also out outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like it's well balanced you know like i'm shy when it's i guess okay to be shy you know and i'm outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore it feels good like if that makes sense but yeah;i understand
271840.0;300974.0;<laughter> yeah to uh relax um either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter> so that helps and i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when i use the color blue because the color blue um relaxes me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down;cool
301740.0;304121.0;yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah;how are you at controlling your temper
304370.0;330005.0;my temper um well my thoughts my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah that's pretty much how my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so controlling my temper is just by training my thought;mm
330780.0;358789.0;um <sigh> the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no so that kinda frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace so;yeah
359150.0;363443.0;yeah;tell me about your relationship with your family
363580.0;386480.0;my family um it's pretty good um my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married and my brothers and sisters um we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's like a team;that's good
386910.0;400787.0;a situation i wish i could handle differently would be hmm that's a good question i mean can i get a scenerio;whatever comes to your mind
401380.0;431143.0;okay um a situation i could handle differently well see that's the thing like i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe how would i handle the situation would be just by uh failing um failing making mistakes because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after so that's the best way i could answer your question you know;okay
430700.0;434528.0;yeah;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
434770.0;461523.0;a positive influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean they're actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah;mm
462310.0;498077.0;mm well see that's the thing like you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like scar me it did prepare me for like the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like you know like guns knives and all that stuff so;wow
497460.0;511559.0;it's it's bad but it's good in the long term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know and;yeah
512040.0;517425.0;so yeah;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
517320.0;528131.0;the hardest um man this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it;(laughter
528910.0;533172.0;but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing;yeah
533750.0;563175.0;life changing whether to continue school college or not mm i kinda chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so yeah;are you happy you did that
563510.0;569467.0;yeah yeah;that's good
570010.0;578791.0;um it's actually really easy i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down;wow
581210.0;582887.0;like like slow down my air pattern;(laughter

728120.0;757517.0;um being depressed mm let's see mm i don't know like it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses so like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed but then what happened i fixed it like called up a friend and met up with him and yeah;that's good

831100.0;869064.0;yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art <laughter> like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like like trash and then i'd be like oh damn either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kinda dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah usually it's um people's words and ideas that;i understand

277250.0;329687.0;um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um uh having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of um uh i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and um the betterment of of uh of those things um bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um uh so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell;okay
329870.0;364874.0;um i think i'm someone who's um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that i think at heart i'm shy um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges;okay
367745.0;374907.0;uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today;can you tell me about that

503210.0;523456.0;um i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again and to leave um uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered;yeah
523910.0;547272.0;well that that was my family that was um the the good side of my family there's um uh uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive;how close are you to your family
547600.0;570095.0;um i don't have any relationship with my family at all like the since i was um uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um uh disowned me i guess is the right word estranged yeah;okay
570620.0;615901.0;um gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second um something i could um erase um <laughter> i can't even get it to my memory um uh as an example um uh i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory;can you tell me more about that
615530.0;696897.0;yeah um i was injured in um the emergency room scrubbed_entry doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um by a doctor um i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um uh what do you call it um uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake um eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis and so um every time i think about the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled um for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well;oh no

1159950.0;1164889.0;the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways;i see what you mean
1164800.0;1170748.0;mhm;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
1170670.0;1271045.0;um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um uh what else um um my insecurity uh as far as um uh just um with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um that i don't do something that that um hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them um or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um i wish i didn't feel um uh so um uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um my family um of not having one um and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um;mhm
1272460.0;1319975.0;and i also wish that um and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um uh the the symptomology of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely um and i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken and someone who is well-written um but there's many there's many more um uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more;yeah
1325100.0;1395285.0;<sigh> um i'm not sure uh <sniffle> maybe to um not be so trusting um i trusted um i trusted some medical professionals that um you know again created the injury and um you know were there's a uh what's the word there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just blindly trust um the medical profession um and <sniffle> um don't ask questions and just sort of um you know and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition um and so i would i would've told myself to be a little more careful um i guess if that's useful to your question;mhm

261170.0;294226.0;um i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics;are you happy you did that
294340.0;300920.0;yeah i'm really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life;that's great

345930.0;369835.0;from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
370070.0;388055.0;um see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea;(laughter
391290.0;426401.0;probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i would've just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now it's just awkward;that sucks
426470.0;432656.0;yeah it does;tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make
434325.0;472360.0;the hardest decision i've ever had to make man that's a toughy i don't think i've had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision;okay

492610.0;517345.0;something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part i know that's kinda weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy;that's great

523370.0;553602.0;uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm;mhm
555740.0;594900.0;my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them <th> them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life;that's so good to hear

679470.0;697528.0;and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and it's just seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her;that's great

741400.0;759023.0;just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and that's not i'm not going that way right now so;i understand
759190.0;765545.0;mhm;tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself

823620.0;828961.0;yeah;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
829570.0;844015.0;ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya;is there anything you regret

111590.0;146775.0;uh well uh i love going to mexico and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but uh the uh the level of of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds;yeah
147760.0;152406.0;traveling you mean;yeah
153710.0;184478.0;uh i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place;nice
185120.0;189950.0;i studied biology;how did you decide to do that
191250.0;202765.0;uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also;are you still working in that
203260.0;209617.0;not at all i'm working in areas of business now;are you happy you did that
210520.0;213572.0;yes i am;what's your dream job
214790.0;220625.0;my dream job would be to be a missionary;really
221300.0;223339.0;yes;can you tell me about that
224700.0;280263.0;my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that;yeah
280050.0;287644.0;i exercise;okay
289700.0;300175.0;i think i'm pretty good at it uh uh i think i'm pretty effective at it;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
301560.0;313316.0;it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her uh lack of consideration;how did you feel in that moment
314820.0;325733.0;um i felt frustrated;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
327020.0;379917.0;hmm a situation which i wished i could handle differently um i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that is so wrong and so in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that uh takes care of the anger immediately;has that gotten you in trouble
381020.0;405190.0;yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end uh it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble;that makes sense
405990.0;440349.0;uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued uh at length for many months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh uh difficult period in my life;i see
441750.0;469459.0;mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their uh betrayals uh but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today;mm
470650.0;516723.0;uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that um even though my father was somewhat of a uh hard-handed uh and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil;i'm sorry
518545.0;549906.0;uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and uh he's not working he's very highly educated and he uh well he doesn't talk to me and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family;that sounds really hard
551090.0;554845.0;yes;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
556150.0;584831.0;you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest and kind uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers;i understand
586540.0;609270.0;eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago;how have you been feeling lately
610720.0;637576.0;um xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future about whether i will survive this or not;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
638040.0;642325.0;not really;do you feel down
642970.0;647187.0;no;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
647470.0;650702.0;never;have you been diagnosed with depression
651230.0;655369.0;never;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
657330.0;675747.0;oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion;that's so good to hear
677130.0;691001.0;funny jovial uh uh intelligent a perfectionist;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
692560.0;710881.0;hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um maybe uh is to submerge my uh hedonistic self;can you tell me about that
712100.0;760566.0;i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um uh deferrer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was whereas i am looking always for the present um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away;yeah
759500.0;794308.0;<deep breath> it would be my ex-boss and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continued to use more profanity until uh i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago;wow
794630.0;797826.0;mhm;is there anything you regret
800060.0;809243.0;anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids;could you have done anything to avoid it
811010.0;862039.0;sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not we do not have the highest uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree;right
864170.0;891753.0;mm that's a good one i would say <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far;tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed
893210.0;922137.0;i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me;that's great
922080.0;975981.0;<deep breath> i would say <sigh> my devotion to the environment uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um uh a steward of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment;okay i think i have asked everything i need to

60060.0;66743.0;i'm well thank you how are you;that's good
67410.0;69850.0;i grew up in oklahoma;really
69760.0;72571.0;mhm;when did you move to l_a
72975.0;82827.0;um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here;how often do you go back to your hometown
82980.0;93929.0;my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much;how does it compare to l_a
94010.0;110236.0;<sniffle> oklahoma's very different um uh l_a's a lot more exciting there's a lot more um uh to do here and um uh the ocean obviously is very nice so;mhm
110940.0;126179.0;um you know that's a good question i um i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come;are you happy you did that
126390.0;131561.0;very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made;that's so good to hear
131535.0;134683.0;<laughter>;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
135280.0;144344.0;pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural it seemed like a good fit um i just really like it here;how do you like your living situation
144540.0;164733.0;oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice;awesome
165360.0;176220.0;mm i studied philosophy and um political theory and government and did a little bit of english literature on the side;how did you decide to do that
176975.0;194568.0;um it kind of just happened naturally i think uh i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different areas and i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that;are you still working in that
195350.0;204407.0;um not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities;mhm
203940.0;211043.0;um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often;what's your dream job
211220.0;233055.0;<laughter> um you know i have actually studied to become a success coach um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams;how hard is that
233940.0;267830.0;um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that um you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too;yeah
266500.0;270725.0;um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so;why
271560.0;305849.0;um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged and i think that um is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers;okay
306380.0;315079.0;<laughter> pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time;has that gotten you in trouble
316750.0;325503.0;not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
325355.0;359846.0;hmm hmm i'm not sure it would've probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would've been a friendly argument um probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually can't remember the specific time;mm
356260.0;374686.0;<laughter> <sniffle> mm i meditate um i do that almost every day um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts;mhm
377150.0;384857.0;so that's nice;that's good
385460.0;425519.0;mm well let me think about that for a minute <sigh> hmm <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle> <sigh> hmm;let's come back to that later
424780.0;432332.0;okay i'm sorry <laughter>;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
433610.0;504407.0;hmm well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but um i do have it sometimes probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it you know if i didn't have it um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i study and attend class the way i should have um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating and i'm not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so;mhm
505450.0;516234.0;no i don't think so um at least not not that i'm aware of;okay
517060.0;574579.0;<sniffle> i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um i when i used to live there when he was younger um spent a lot of time with them and since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them um and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so that's um that makes me feel bad sometimes;i understand
574380.0;637701.0;mm um well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's younger and um he's like four four and a half years younger he's married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them um on my father's side there's one brother um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so;okay
639050.0;713839.0;um i'd say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbed_entry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice;that's so good to hear
714390.0;755841.0;i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful um and i can sleep uh you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i don't remember it so;uh huh
757140.0;805483.0;um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i um sleep poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate and um i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle;okay
806650.0;827578.0;i would say good um summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
830600.0;867091.0;not really i can't i can't think of anything um there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um and i hike with friends and um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated um because i didn't really exercise when i was there and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like;i'm sorry
867030.0;871589.0;it's okay thank you;have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
871960.0;874918.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
875350.0;879009.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
879500.0;904203.0;hmm well scrubbed_entry he's a lot of fun and um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun;how would your best friend describe you
904870.0;939728.0;hmm <sigh> well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and um that i you know care about others uh and that i'm loyal and i'm not sure what else um i think those those are probably the main things;okay
939510.0;982827.0;<sniffle> um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so um i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging um and i wish that i um xxx i don't know uh i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things;okay
981700.0;1046638.0;mm hmm so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i don't feel like she was um i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh used to push my buttons or so i thought and so um one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer um and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was um but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people <peo> with staff members;yeah
1046570.0;1090736.0;and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it and um i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so;yeah
1091960.0;1147310.0;<laughter> so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago;hmm
1148875.0;1181335.0;<sigh> probably scrubbed_entry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so;okay
1183230.0;1223345.0;<sigh> let's see well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore uh and i got to fly first class um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too;nice

347470.0;369423.0;um almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said that i that i don't um just because um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them;hmm

107680.0;126642.0;uh the traffic which is probably <probab> probably most people say um it's expensive to live here those are probably the top two;i see what you mean
126830.0;131722.0;uh recently i've traveled;what do you enjoy about traveling
133040.0;147756.0;um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
148510.0;156821.0;oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week;nice
154580.0;172125.0;uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid;yeah
173170.0;196366.0;trying to you know say you know what's this what's this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult;mhm
196230.0;199610.0;i'm probably more of a shy person;why
201450.0;206260.0;genetics i don't know why;what did you study at school
207080.0;217525.0;um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction i've also studied uh computer networking;cool
218920.0;241262.0;um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain;are you happy you did that
240560.0;251206.0;mm uh it's given me a lot of opportunity but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life;what's your dream job
252470.0;274462.0;well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training;what made you decide to do that
275850.0;302160.0;um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them;that's great
303240.0;324592.0;well in my immediate family um i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family;how close are you to your family
325230.0;352595.0;um i'm really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents;i see
353830.0;365006.0;um i'd say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me;can you tell me about that
365760.0;391236.0;um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible;okay
392340.0;432198.0;um i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when you know i'll i'll get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to;right
435490.0;458356.0;to keep so when <whe> when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
458970.0;515888.0;um <sigh> well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadn't really in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and;yeah
516370.0;529644.0;and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was;how did you feel in that moment
531120.0;536371.0;um are you asking the moment of during the conflict;yeah
536850.0;553172.0;uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger;mm
554270.0;566721.0;so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger;okay
567310.0;653257.0;mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didn't feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me;yeah
655580.0;659759.0;tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory;mhm
660380.0;701381.0;um oh let me see i'm not sure um i don't know i i can't really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase;okay
702260.0;715231.0;um usually usually it's not too bad um are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping;yeah
715820.0;743023.0;um the the job i work the the um kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts so um coming home in the morning you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work;i understand
743310.0;746748.0;uh it pretty easy;what are you like when you don't sleep well
747350.0;753862.0;um when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky;how have you been feeling lately
752590.0;762037.0;uh i i've been feeling good lately;that's good
764110.0;770600.0;no not really;okay
771010.0;773623.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
773940.0;777790.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
779950.0;828265.0;um hmm i don't know um can't think of anything that was kinda out of the ordinary but um yesterday we my wife and i took took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one um stayed with her grandma but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played and yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park;that's so good to hear
830020.0;867746.0;um i i think he'd say i'm a a family man that um i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me um usually my my friend i end up doing um different work around the house for him 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice;mhm
868160.0;908334.0;um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that;uh huh
909260.0;912907.0;now if it's;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
913400.0;948247.0;okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult uh advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um that's about it;okay
948340.0;956386.0;think that would made that would've made the biggest difference in my life i think;what are you most proud of in your life

673342.0;715926.0;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept;mm
720489.0;742625.0;and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is i'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably;what made you decide to do that
743929.0;857220.0;um xxx <sigh> ooh um <sigh> where do i begin <sigh> um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i <deep breath> <laughter> you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened;okay
858670.0;993350.0;oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um <laughter> my <m> my ex i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina 'cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it but it's still it's it's still there and i think uh i i don't know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is <i> is just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know <laughter> earthquakes <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming;yeah
994770.0;999155.0;yes;have you been diagnosed with depression
999370.0;1003258.0;<laughter> yeah;how long ago were you diagnosed
1003590.0;1042358.0;<sigh> um mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times that's no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which would've been <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago i don't know xxx i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's it's when i first was told that i was depressed;mhm
1042460.0;1070542.0;um as far as p_t_s_d goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing;what got you to seek help
1072140.0;1110552.0;um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it um you know just kinda happened;do you still go to therapy now
1111849.0;1115926.0;no not not anymore;why did you stop
1116850.0;1138912.0;um eh <sigh> <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter> uh geez uh you know i really don't know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore;do you feel like therapy is useful
1139611.0;1165243.0;uh sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know;right
1166080.0;1197841.0;um <sigh> i guess it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on;yeah
1198520.0;1226551.0;<sigh> um wow <laughter> um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out;that's so good to hear
1226970.0;1297744.0;um well for starters i mean you <y> you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh i'd i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um <sigh> i don't know uh make myself less fat <laughter> um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know;yeah
1299227.0;1311070.0;like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too;i see what you mean
1310347.0;1318564.0;i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much;okay
1319187.0;1330883.0;um <sigh> um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way;(laughter
1332317.0;1401184.0;um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh asperger's so that's a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric 'cause i totally am i just i i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive and you know who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for so i should you know live while i'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm;yeah
1401650.0;1411307.0;except when i'm reading and i like reading;okay
1412380.0;1472847.0;<sigh> um uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up um i think i would've told myself at the time um 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known my my evil ex um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted um and more importantly don't <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that;mm
1473430.0;1497664.0;and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it;okay
1499240.0;1531981.0;<sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive maybe yeah uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride i don't really feel pride i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>;yeah
1532577.0;1544640.0;i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows;okay i think i have asked everything i need to
1548030.0;1550358.0;do i press the button now oh bye;yeah
1551680.0;1552160.0;okay;
10910.0;46702.0;<synch> <laughter>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
46570.0;51612.0;yes;okay
52330.0;56996.0;i'm doing well;that's good
57480.0;64064.0;i was born in oakland;really
64780.0;75521.0;um <sigh> all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here;mhm
75900.0;93226.0;the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality;i see what you mean
90540.0;99152.0;<laughter> i i don't i would love to travel more;what do you enjoy about traveling
99980.0;117058.0;um <sigh> being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective;uh huh
118360.0;143020.0;um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family;nice
143620.0;164255.0;um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting;mhm
165110.0;184866.0;um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah;that's great
185440.0;191392.0;right now i'm getting my master's in social work;what's your dream job
192060.0;232848.0;<laughter> dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics;okay
233220.0;264278.0;i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful;that makes sense
261600.0;277393.0;<laughter> um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things;mhm
277090.0;288473.0;also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise;cool
289370.0;303992.0;pretty good i don't get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that;that's good
304290.0;341341.0;hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend i've had for a few years;hmm
342150.0;360102.0;i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions;okay
361310.0;391504.0;i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me;mhm
392190.0;441746.0;hmm <laughter> that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did;okay
441890.0;480571.0;mm <clears throat> hardest decision <sigh> wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on;yeah
481420.0;504729.0;um <sigh> i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program;that makes sense
505140.0;549283.0;<sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh> oh <laughter> um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind;i'm sorry to hear that
550790.0;584089.0;um <laughter> <laughter> i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family;uh huh
588950.0;600607.0;um so in general i'm not really that close to family;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
601680.0;633326.0;um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things;that's great
633630.0;641729.0;<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up;why
642970.0;662108.0;because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed;i understand
662730.0;664158.0;<clears throat>;how do you cope with them
665820.0;698292.0;i think just <sigh> self-talk about how what i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going;mhm
699740.0;729896.0;<sigh> feeling <sigh> uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time;uh huh
730090.0;734064.0;no i haven't;have you been diagnosed with depression
733960.0;737224.0;yes;how long ago were you diagnosed
737270.0;741844.0;in two thousand six;what got you to seek help
743010.0;775041.0;the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed;yeah
775700.0;780371.0;yes i do;do you feel like therapy is useful
781100.0;785948.0;yes;what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy
786780.0;823656.0;i notice i'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them i'm <sigh> able to think <th> think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas <clears throat>;that's good
825060.0;841125.0;mm <sigh> um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again;awesome
841920.0;870762.0;<laughter> um <sigh> people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual;uh huh
871750.0;896453.0;um i wish that i did not or wait i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy;okay
897540.0;941546.0;<laughter> start going to therapy now <laughter> um but yeah i really would and also to what how old am i twenty eight ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career;okay
942180.0;964331.0;um i think the fact that i'm in grad school and coming from the background that i that i come from low socio-economic status and just pushing through challenges to get here;that's so good to hear

267420.0;290435.0;um we he i was engaged to him fifteen years ago and he recently called me i guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and i asked my husband if i could go help him in his time of need and i'm here;wow

356750.0;362684.0;mhm;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
364030.0;392734.0;um i really don't wanna erase anything from my memory i've actually um learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so i'm not <ss> i'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind i categorize them and place them in memories;okay

660930.0;661280.0;bye bye;
12340.0;53711.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
54480.0;61124.0;yes;okay
61290.0;65720.0;i'm fine thank you;that's good
66610.0;68613.0;detroit michigan;really
70110.0;71281.0;yes;when did you move to l_a
73710.0;86070.0;i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago;mm
87270.0;91678.0;uh i don't go back to detroit anymore;why
93650.0;106812.0;i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and;that makes sense
108380.0;128782.0;uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe;mhm
128300.0;132024.0;that i that i like better;why did you move to l_a
133860.0;149294.0;after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at;how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a
149740.0;169541.0;extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it;that's good
170690.0;209258.0;well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh less crowded it's more open space it's a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens;i see what you mean
210200.0;223212.0;the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like;yeah
221170.0;234316.0;i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all so i don't travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide;what do you enjoy about traveling
237100.0;242101.0;new experiences;i'd love to hear about one of your trips
242950.0;271155.0;well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i've traveled a lot of different places and um i'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience;uh huh
272490.0;293532.0;uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso i've also visited uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different;yeah
294430.0;320895.0;i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing;okay
322270.0;328054.0;i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike;mhm
328360.0;333729.0;listen to music you know;how are you at controlling your temper
334950.0;341262.0;i'm very good at controlling my temper;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
343100.0;359606.0;oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him;okay
360780.0;364641.0;it could be it could be a choice of;tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently
364560.0;409337.0;uh some of the instances when i might've been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm;yeah
412500.0;434931.0;um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so;i see what you mean
438070.0;478979.0;well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious outcome for them as well;yeah
479120.0;485438.0;mhm;tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory
487390.0;511965.0;<sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the uh impact of the event 'cause there might be something that;mm
513850.0;516335.0;you can gain from that;yeah
516480.0;556313.0;but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so;right
557550.0;611479.0;um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here;mhm
611850.0;631538.0;so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment;yeah
632440.0;692103.0;well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have;mm
692670.0;698271.0;pardon i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat;who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life
699600.0;707783.0;hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends;can you tell me about that
709070.0;749402.0;well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have um been very um positive <po> positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so;okay
750450.0;781357.0;it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but um in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done;i see what you mean
782670.0;797621.0;i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so um but in general good;have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately
799190.0;828079.0;like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out;okay
828830.0;839759.0;no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have;right
840650.0;845857.0;i have not no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
849380.0;879513.0;well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be;yeah
883520.0;895150.0;you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel;i understand
896480.0;915377.0;um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat;is there anything you regret
917530.0;947971.0;um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see you know you could've done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that;what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago
949690.0;974612.0;i would have um made myself move to california sooner and i'm i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss> would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information <in> information available;yeah
977710.0;985297.0;you know after you have looked at several options;mhm
986030.0;1002854.0;of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself;that's great
1003090.0;1004731.0;okay;goodbye
1004870.0;1005460.0;bye bye now;
11710.0;55576.0;<synch>;hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this
55990.0;61282.0;yes;okay
61530.0;65908.0;fine;that's good
66840.0;72975.0;oh san fernando valley;really
74140.0;85241.0;uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around;mhm
85850.0;103090.0;it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system;i see what you mean
102960.0;110335.0;uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel;when was the last time that happened
111350.0;120813.0;um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class;nice
121990.0;124423.0;yeah it was fun;what's one of your most memorable experiences
125160.0;157048.0;hmm <sigh> i think it's tough to say;whatever comes to your mind
158140.0;174667.0;um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night;awesome
175240.0;178115.0;philosophy;are you still working in that
178480.0;182868.0;yes;how did you decide to do that
183680.0;204744.0;um hmm i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy;that makes sense
205940.0;225747.0;huh i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it;okay
225340.0;249377.0;i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly;uh huh
250140.0;260310.0;um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read um yeah;how are you at controlling your temper
260820.0;277029.0;i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing;when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about
285360.0;317508.0;i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with;yeah
318090.0;339327.0;well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out;i see
340160.0;394393.0;hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him;okay
395180.0;427422.0;hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year;i'm sorry
428030.0;488639.0;uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um <sigh> and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve;that's good
489490.0;517978.0;scrubbed_entry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that;that's great
518480.0;529760.0;i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning;what are you like when you don't sleep well
530520.0;544687.0;um well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just groggy;okay
545400.0;564899.0;pretty good i'm a little anxious about um about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time um yeah;how do you cope with them
566990.0;583380.0;<sigh> well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic;okay
583740.0;588158.0;no;have you been diagnosed with depression
588360.0;592788.0;no;tell me about the last time you felt really happy
595210.0;626268.0;hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun;that's great
627060.0;654704.0;um she would probably say that i'm smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v um and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot;what are some things you wish you could change about yourself
655070.0;673622.0;well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating;tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself
674870.0;730968.0;hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job but it was was not great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation;that sucks
732240.0;754939.0;well i would've been twelve and two um but i think i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then;is there anything you regret
