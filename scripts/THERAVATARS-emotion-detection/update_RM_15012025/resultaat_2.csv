1804;437.735;443.405;Participant;woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect;happy;0.7328723669052124;happy
