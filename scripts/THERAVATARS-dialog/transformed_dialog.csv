i see what you mean;the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic

aw okay what'd you study at school;i studied uh business i did
are you still doing that;no i've i've been done for a few years so i haven't gone to school for a while one of these days i'll go back to graduate school but
awesome what's your dream job;my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i don't know i don't really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment
mhm how hard is that;um i don't know i think it's just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh it's been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so it's a little tougher than it seems <se> it should be but i don't know i think when the situation's right i don't think it's too difficult
yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days;yep
what do you do now;i work as an assistant <as> administrative assistant through a temp agency so it's just basically i get sent out to do uh
cool;to do desk jobs 
are you happy you did that;um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so  you know yeah
okay how close are you to your family;i'm pretty close i mean they're around so
hmm what are some things that make you really mad;um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um that's basically <ba> that's the big thing just just irritating stupid people <laughter> who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all
mhm can you give me an example of that;um what's a good example just random people who who think it's funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn't have to be one any specific situation it's just people who just think it's funny to i think they're just generally sadistic and they just think it's it's funny to to just prod you like it's like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so
right when was the last time that happened;uh god i don't remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember <laughter> when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back
i understand do you consider yourself an introvert;what do you mean
let's come back to that later;okay
what do you do to relax;god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so i'm usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything that's that's generally art and creative
awesome who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;who's been a positive <pos> i think it's just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they they're very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybody's on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don't
mhm;it's sometimes hard to find someone who's gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i don't really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there
like what;you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey you're good at this why aren't you doing that or something like that just you know i'm always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey don't do that that's no that's why are you doing that it's a waste of time
mmm that's good how are you at controlling your temper;um i guess it depends on who you talk to
<laughter>;i'm i'm okay at it i could probably work at that um i don't know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it
can you give me an example of that;well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i don't know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately i've been better at it just because i think my situation's been a little bit better
that's good have you been diagnosed with depression;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you ever served in the military;no
okay is there anything you regret;um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i could've traveled more or i could've worked towards something that paid better job-wise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda would've done but you know but then again i think that's natural for anybody i mean i could i could've become a banker or i could've become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i don't like the law and i don't like medicine so so i'm it wasn't meant to be so
right there are always trade offs in life aren't there;yeah
what made you decide to do that;so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i there's a lot of things i have <ha> there's more dislikes <laughter> than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so
that sounds really hard;no it i don't think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it it's kind of a good thing 'cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn't really fit you doesn't make sense it's like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and it's like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it's not gonna go in so sometimes it's just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you
right that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences;memorable experiences um hmm i think it's just i don't really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it's positive or negative i think it's just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that i'm able i'm able to get this far in life without like completely self-destructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like i've gotten somewhere
that's great;maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren't you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire
yeah i see what you mean;yeah
when was the last time you felt really happy;um when was the last time i really felt happy um i don't know i'm not really someone who's like i don't have any real high highs or low lows i mean i haven't hit any lows so i mean i i don't know i'm usually pretty i feel like i'm a level person and i'm pretty happy <ha> every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then i'm pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if i'm able to accomplish something then then hey i'm happy
that's great how would your best friend describe you;i don't know i don't really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that i'm very <ver> pretty outgoing i'm pretty determined i'm trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible i'm always out networking as much as possible so i don't know i guess that's basically what i think they would describe me as
okay okay i think i've asked everything i need to;okay

goodbye ;bye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  how are you doing today;okay how 'bout yourself
i'm great thanks where are you from originally;here in california

what's your dream job;well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature
mhm that sounds like a great situation ;thanks
how hard is that;well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible 
that makes sense  do you consider yourself an introvert;what do you mean i'm sorry
let's come back to that later;okay
what do you do to relax;read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes
okay how are you at controlling your temper ;i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time
right how hard is that;well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated
has that gotten you in trouble;no i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today
that's good yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family  
that sounds like a great situation;thank you
do you find it easy to be a parent;no <laughter>
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home
mhm can you give me an example of that;well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature
mhm  tell me about your kids;i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old
aw;yeah i'm 'bout to be well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time
wow awesome ;yeah thank you
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and
yeah;they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can
yeah i see what you mean what's one of your most memorable experiences ;with my kids or just period
whatever comes to your mind;what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know
wow;and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me 
that's so good to hear;thank you
how did you feel in that moment ;happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week
yeah that sounds like a great situation ;thank you
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career
right yeah could you have done anything to avoid it;i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so 
yeah there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there ;yes
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but
right;that just happened you know i just told her i'm not
how close are you to them;i'm sorry
how close are you to them;very close very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I'll be telling
tell me more about that;she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite
mhm;and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change
yeah how hard is that;it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but
yeah yeah;the ball is her court you know i only can do so much
i'm sorry i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know
mhm do you feel that way often;pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me
right what are you like when you don't sleep well;what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter>
<laughter> what do you do when you're annoyed;i never thought about that i just you know 'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm
hm okay have you ever served in the military ;no
have you been diagnosed with depression ;no
okay how would you best friend describe you ;i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible i'm a um people person i get along with others you know i'm kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark
mhm;whether i know you or not if you was to you know like  like you and i now you know i um you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that

oh what's it like for you living with them;it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah 
could you have done anything to avoid it ;yes <laughter> 
could you say a little more about that ;um i had a different option to live with somebody else and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever 
mm i'm sorry to hear that;that's fine
how do you know them;how do i know who i
let's come back to that later;yeah <laughter>
what are some things that make you really mad ;there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um
whatever comes to your mind;um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe 
mhm;that really gets me mad
okay do you consider yourself an introvert;mm yes 
why;because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah
do you feel that way often;yeah
okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about ;wow i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter>
really;yeah oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago
<laughter> how did you feel in that moment;uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all
mhm can you tell me about that;um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter> 
oh my gosh;and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that
yeah that sucks;yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good
that's so good to hear;yeah
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;to not  believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible
hm okay tell me more about that;i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances  so
hm;yeah
what's one of your most memorable experiences;when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago

that's good what do you think of today's kids;mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah
<laughter>;no comment on that they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so

yes;uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so  uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh I couldn't um i haven't really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school 
yeah;and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so um but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little
mhm that's good what's your dream job;my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah
really;i like being alone
how did you decide to do that;pardon me
how did you decide to do that;well you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i don't like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a
mhm;outdoors type of guy so
yeah i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge 
wow;uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed 
mhm;so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know it's been great
nice what are some things you really like about l_a;uh probably um one some of the things i like about l_a there's not a lot that i like about l_a but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um
uh huh;the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there 
mhm yeah;traffic's atrocious you know
yeah what are some things that make you really mad;traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it
okay;dishonesty
when was the last time that happened;pardon me
when was the last time that happened ;uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes
mm;you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that
yeah that sucks;yeah big time
what do you do when you're annoyed;what do i do when i'm annoyed
mhm;um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek
wow yeah how hard is that;uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions
yeah when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything
mhm;and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all
yeah how did you feel in that moment;pardon me
how did you feel in that moment;um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so
mhm;you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship
i'm sorry to hear that;can't do nothing about it
what are some things you like to do for fun;uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like
that's great what's one of your most memorable experiences;uh most memorable experiences um good or bad
whatever comes to your mind;uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh
oh my gosh;uh just enjoying myself
awesome;i know
how close are you to your family;not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it
okay could you have done anything to avoid it;have i done anything to avoid it
yes;um to avoid them
yes;uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so
i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so
yeah;i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired
mhm do you feel that way often;uh lately i have been probably about the last few months
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head
mhm;and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that 
mm how do you cope with them;how do i what
how do you cope with them;how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews
mm;uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me
yeah has that gotten you in trouble;if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean
yeah;um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done 
mhm;uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities 
mhm that's good do you feel like therapy is useful;pardon me
do you feel like therapy is useful;i still didn't hear you
do you feel like therapy is useful;that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time
why don't we talk about that later;alright
have you been diagnosed with depression;uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism
how hard is that;um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know
mhm;um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just
yeah;and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um
mm;but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way 
yeah;so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad 
i understand did you think you had a problem before you found out;did i have a problem before i got out
did you think you had a problem before you found out;uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know
yeah;me me dealing with life so
how has seeing a therapist affected you;pardon me
how has seeing a therapist affected you;uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know
right;but it's good to have
that's so good to hear;yeah
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will
why did you stop;um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um 
yeah;you know money situation's not that great right now so
i'm sorry how would your best friend describe you;how does my friends describe me
yeah;um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot
<laughter>;um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know
mhm;and uh so 
 who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;someone who has been a positive influence in my life
yeah;someone who's been um someone who's been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didn't teach i don't know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself 
mhm;and uh sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it you know
that sounds like a great situation;yeah it was
okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;you're welcome
goodbye;bye <laughter>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential how are you doing today;fine
that's good where are you from originally;uh colorado
really;mhm
why'd you move to l_a;uh career career possibilities
hm what do you do now;uh paralegal
awesome when did you move to l_a;uh for further education for the weather for a friend [laughter] 
mhm how often do you go back to your home town;not often at all now every few years
aww what are some things you really like about l_a;oh the weather uh the beach sunsets at the beach uh the thought of uh career possibilities um an educated group of people sophisticated market
uh huh how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;it is an adjustment uh to to come here a lot of people misjudge it a little bit it's a laid back appearing town but it's actually very um uh sensitive to you know uh success and commericalization and that kind of thing so you have to keep up the pace
yeah yeah how hard is that;uh that is a little bit harder i think when you first make the adjustment and pretty soon it becomes obvious that it's another market that you just have to work hard in like you you do in others
mhm that makes sense what's your dream job;oh be an attorney [laughter] mhm
really why;oh just because you have the uh the power you can use uh you know skills to be able to affect people live people's lives in a more dramatic way than just being uh an assistant in that field
cool how close are you to your family;oh uh a lot of it is not around anymore just have brothers and sisters out of state so not particularly close right now
i'm sorry what are some things that make you really mad;uh mm dishonesty unkindness  lack of sympathy uh insensitivity you know
yeah how are you at controlling your temper;uh very good if anything i'm i'm uh regressive that way [laughter]
[laughter] that's good;mhm
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh wow uh oh just a friend a friend who is who is right now a has a fabulous job is uh spending too much money that he needs to save
uh oh how do you know them;uh through uh a work situation just a a work connection  mutual friends mhm
how close are you to them;uh close close now we spend time we have uh we go out and have fun sometimes
that's good what are some things you like to do for fun;uh walk walk on the beach uh you know uh shop in beach areas is kind of fun rodeo drive occasionally
mhm;and uh and see films art art galleries
okay who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;oh uh my daughter
aww tell me about your kids;i just have one daughter who graduated u_c_l_a law school and uh i raised her totally alone without any help so it seemed like an accomplishment that was was worth it the the two jobs and the work
wow yeah do you find it easy to be a parent;uh i think it's difficult i think it's a difficult job that takes a lot more work than most people give it credit for if you wanna do it right you know it's always second guessing your behavior and that kind of thing
mhm what's the hardest thing about being a parent;uh just uh i'd say peer pressure it can totally alter [al] alter anything a parent has tried to put into a child that's good
yeah can you give me an example of that;scrubbed_entry so that was a really bad time for us
that sounds really hard what do you think of today's kids;um i think it depends on which neighborhood or state you're in or the the uh i i think they're a little misguided i think a little uninspired [unin] uninspired right now i think they're being weighed down by the concerns of the wars and um and things like that and i think they can probably use a  uh a common goal a common you know now a team uh as as oppposed to just being more separated group than a family [fam] once they were i think you know kind of uninspired right now
yeah i see what you mean how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um i worry sometimes about you know work issues but it's pretty pretty easy
do you feel that way often;um no i i don't feel like i'm not sleeping i i just you know will occasionally worry about something at work
when was the last time that happened;oh gosh about a couple weeks ago
how did you feel in that moment;oh just uh you know unfortunately we have to worry you know i'm fortunate this isn't easier it's just cooperation between people uh it solves most everything you know so you always wanna have that around you
mhm what are you like when you don't sleep well;um just stressed yeah stressed more stressed
that sounds really hard;mhm
do you feel down;um yeah fatigue has uh a lot of uh you know a lot of implications for just not feeling like yourself or misjudging things that you might judge differently if you were more well rested
yeah have you been diagnosed with depression;uh not depression
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;um probably yeah i was that was considered a possibility i had an employment lawsuit several years ago and and uh actually litigated it and won the settlement um something about whistleblower thing implications [im] implications of that and um and i was kind of harrassed about it and so i found when i got out of it i couldn't find work right away in my own field so i had to go into a different field go back to u_c_l_a and get a new uh professional direction and i found myself fearful sometimes that it's gonna happen again you know and you think that would never happen again you know
mhm i'm sorry to hear that what got you to seek help;um just that i was noticing that i was noticing i was feeling very uh in my paralegal class i had a a section about employment law and there was a a very complicated filing i had done with great a deal of work and study for my case but once faced with it again in that class setting i just i just couldn't get it done it was a late paper from me and i realized i was traumatized by having to go through that again um that you know yeah post traumatic stress sometimes comes later after the adrenaline dies down
yeah;from what i understand and um so i think it was just uh it was just hitting me later you know that i was having to face that paper again and wow you know no adrenaline just wow there is a xxxx
hmm;back back
what were your symptoms;just uh just extreme uh you know avoidance of getting something done that should've been easy for me  and uh and thinking about it as thoroughly as i should've or studying it or putting it off uh putting the feeling of going through that paper that type of paper even if it's just a class assignment again you know
yeah have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;well um not lately um you know back then for sure when that happened which was about ten years ago now it was settled in court about seven years ago now and uh yeah it was it was effective you know it was effective in the way you view most everything and in your confidence and that kinda thing
do you feel like therapy is useful;i'm sorry [laughter] repeat the question
do you feel like therapy is useful;uh peaceful do i feel peaceful well yeah i was peaceful that it that it's settled uh but but angry that it ever happened so it's hard to i'll probably not ever feel peaceful about that issue ever it always the mention of it always makes me angry that i had to go through that yeah
yeah could you have done anything to avoid it;i don't think so i tried everything to avoid it [laughter] you know and so uh uh i think that's that was aggravating for me too because i'm a patient person realistic and um and i tried everything to avoid uh confrontation in the matter but it was just required to try to you know help me cover the damage to our lives my daughter's life
yeah do you consider yourself an introvert;i uh not now maybe one time in my life not now you if you can't communicate uh you know if you could communicate you could overcome people's perceptions or their judgments of you if you can effectively explain something and and uh it will help you overcome other perceptions of yourself that others might normally have judgments for age or anything like that
yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences;um well just raising a daughter extendedly you know or or uh you know just um the experience of thinking thinking that that was a after all the years that was a success her graduating from law school yeah
yeah how did you feel in that moment;uh just like a lot of work had a good ending uh  you know happy glad that it was fulfilled wishes or or dreams for this child were fulfilled you know that and she was able to make that success
that's great when was the last time you felt really happy;wow um [laughter] i i i tend to be kind of happy with life 'cause the alternative is gonna harm harm your you know your ability to succeed so i try to force happiness i guess in in most every situation in my life route i find something about it uh when i lost some weight recently that made me really happy
wow that's great do you travel a lot;i travel a little bit locally i traveled more when i was younger i really enjoyed that but just been too busy in the last few years
yeah what do you enjoy about traveling;just new places um ability to take the worries we have every day work  or concerns and kind of put them away for a while and see something new  you know kind of the way
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;i'm going back to uh colorado san riosco went through vale  and uh and spent the night there and um and it was just during spring when there aren't many skiiers and it was just beautiful and very quiet a lot of restaurants with the decks and open in the mountains and it was beautiful
that sounds like a great situation;yeah
how would your best friend describe you;wow uh just um ardent i'm hard working loyal uh um creative
okay what's the best thing about being a parent;um just seeing something that you're creating you're trying to create uh becomes something you hoped the picture would be you know if if that's the case you know just hard work uh just fulfilled or or presented itself in a certain way that you know it makes you happy
yeah how close are you to them;to my daughter um very [ver] pretty close she just had a baby she's in the bay area she send me pictures all the time
aww that's great okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;okay
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend i don't judge i can't i'm a computer    i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential ;<laughter>
where are you from originally;um moscow
really why'd you move to l_a;um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a; uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though
that's good how do you like your living situation;it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between
[laughter];the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while
yeah how do you know them;one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist
how close are you to them;it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant
aww tell me more about that;oh about the distant
yes;okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room
uh oh;and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move 
yeah that sucks;it's okay it'll get better
yeah how are you at controlling your temper;it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger
why;oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter]
[laughter] that makes sense;yeah
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah
wow;um
can you give me an example of that;of of what 
how do you know them;uh my friend nicole
yeah;um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then
nice;mhm
what are some things you like to do for fun;um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever
okay how close are you to your family;uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them
mm;so i guess superficially close
okay;but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess
that's good;mhm
what are some things that make you really mad;uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess
yeah  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through
[laughter] yeah do you feel that way often;about other people or about myself or angry
whatever comes to your mind;xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often
okay what's your dream job;dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so
mhm yeah;something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess
okay do you travel a lot;i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries
wow;i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome
yeah;um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot
what do you enjoy about traveling;in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up
i see what you mean i'd love to hear about one of your trips;oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon
oh my gosh;i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too
yeah i see what you mean;cool
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy
what are you like when you don't sleep well;oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world
do you feel that way often;i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing
yeah it can be tough to find a good job these days;yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for
mhm;so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know
that sounds really hard;yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so
yeah do you feel down;uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter]
nice;yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation
yeah i'm sorry;it's all good
have you been diagnosed with depression;uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds
okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;nope
have you ever served in the military;nope
okay what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago
like what;well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense
yeah yeah what do you do to relax;uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so
yeah what's one of your most memorable experiences ;[laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year
aww;and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing 
mhm;um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one
that's great;yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter]
awesome;yeah
how would your best friend describe you;bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um

what do you enjoy about traveling;i don't i don't enjoy traveling
what'd you study at school;uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly
are you still working in that;yes i am actually
what do you do now;right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire
awesome;impressive
what's your dream job;professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest
<laughter>;you're actually pretty good at this
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;<sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning
mhm that's so good to hear;okay
how are you at controlling your temper;i'm pretty good i think
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all
okay how close are you to your family;fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also
aw that's good;interesting
do you consider yourself an introvert;yes
why;because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted
i see what you mean what do you do to relax;i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least
cool what do you do when you're annoyed;i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think
okay what do you think of today's kids;<deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion
mm that makes sense what's one of your most memorable experiences ;<sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry
awesome;thank you
how would your best friend describe you;i don't really have a best friend introverted remember
okay what would you say are some of your best qualities;i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood;when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood
nice;thank you
what are you most proud of in your life;right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all
tell me more about that;interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid
yeah;okay
when was the last time you felt really happy;um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class
cool;thank you
have you ever served in the military;yes briefly  many years ago <ag> yes
really why'd you decide to enlist in the military;i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that 
how old were you when you joined the military;um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two
you were very young weren't you ;yes not really
how did serving in the military change you;i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much
mm what did you do after the military;graduate school in physics
okay have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;nope
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard i guess moderately 
that makes sense;thank you
do you feel that way often;yes
i'm sorry;it's okay
what are you like when you don't sleep well;i'm probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function
uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;no maybe slightly
okay;sorry no yes yes i have changes in my thoughts
okay tell me more about that;um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that
how hard is that;what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school
yes;i understand
why don't we talk about that later;okay i agree
okay is there anything you regret;no not really
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally

do you feel like therapy's useful;oh yeah definitely
can you give me an example of that;um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest 
that's so good to hear;<clears throat> thanks
how has seeing a therapist affected you ;um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think

mhm okay thanks for sharing your thoughts with me okay i think i've asked everything i need to goodbye;see you later
[sync] hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  are you okay with this;yes
okay so how are you doing today;quite well feel good
that's good where are you from originally;los angeles california here
really;mhm one of the few um native born los angelinos
[laughter] yeah what do you do now;i uh home school my ten year old son and uh i'm a home maker i have five children and married twenty two years
wow;mhm
do you travel a lot;so that's a full time job huh
do you travel a lot;uh somewhat we can we went to israel about two months ago um for a pilgrimmage with our church yeah so i would say yes i've traveled a bit
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh well most recently we like two months ago went to israel for a pilgrimmage we were gone about nine days and it was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in chorazine which is near the uh galilee and in a place called uh uh i mean the the name of the area is chorazine but uh we stayed in a place called adonis galilea which is a um a house for that welcomes um christian uh pilgrims as well as jewish pilgrims
that's so good to hear what do you enjoy about traveling;um i i enjoy like really the most important thing i enjoy is like meeting the people and and of course seeing the the history i mean especially israel i mean it's the  it's totally ancient but um most most i enjoy is is the the people i think to uh get a better understanding of how different cultures um live
okay do you consider yourself an introvert;no not at all
why;just don't i you know all my life i've always been open and and uh willing to socialize and i remember my younger brother always um joking and saying that i i would talk to anybody and i will i'll talk to just about anybody just because i enjoy learning about other people
that's good what do you do to relax;um most of the time like by the end of the day after i've cooked dinner and we've had dinner together as a family um i there's a word game on the computer that i like to play for a little while and then um watch t_v have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that's what we do and you know 'cause we have a lot going on we don't stay up too late so i like to watch crime dramas
nice what are some things that make you really mad;um really mad probably not a lot um i get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but um in terms of like really um getting like heatedly angry i mean other than like little things that my children do to you know especially my oldest child who's twenty one you know he can be confrontational so other than that nothing gets me like really angry haven't i haven't haven't felt that
okay what's the best thing about being a parent;um contributing to society helping uh helping to raise um responsible people i guess um and of course the love and the affection and the um the fun and the excitement that goes with it of all the stages that go i mean like really right now i'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers i only have i have one eleven year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it's really fun because we're able to um talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world and you know have have uh challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it's it's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff
uh huh what's the hardest thing about being a parent;the hardest thing is that it's twenty four seven um you're never not a parent you know it's and so you have to accept that and that's i remember when i first with my first child um thinking you know when i brought him home from the hospital this is it i mean there's no going back you you cannot um change i mean i guess you could if you did something horrible but i mean under normal circumstances you can't change um that and it's a permanent thing and um it it it uh in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it give you a different sort of freedom
i see what you mean there are always tradeoffs in life aren't there;mhm always
who's someone that's been a positive influence in  your life;i'm sorry i didn't get what you said
what are some things you like to do for fun who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;um some of the things that've been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church um and my faith uh but also my husband he's been a really um he's kind of he's very like logical thinking and very you know grounded so when if i get emotional or i get upset about something he's always we balance each other out likewise if he's upset about something i'm able to balance him out it's been a that's been a a great gift in my life
how are you at controlling your temper;um i don't i i don't think i'd be categorized as somebody with a a temper um occasionally i i occasionally i get angry but i don't like have like rarely do i have outbursts um i'm more more likely to you know to say what i feel not let it build up so with you know like my husband and i don't rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because i i like i said i'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot so if i'm thinking something i usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up
that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um usually i'm arguing with my older son because he um you know he thinks he knows everything he's twenty one years old so he has the know it all mentality  and i'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all and you know as life goes on he'll learn more he's very confident and very self uh self uh what's the word self assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that's all
that sounds really hard;mhm it is it can be mhm
what do you think of today's kids;i think um that many of them are um spoiled and live in an environment of uh of instant gratification um which i think is gonna be um detrimental to the to the future of this country but um you know given that with all the technology we have there's really not any way to go back so i i have um hope that um they will i mean i think this country was built on on uh hard work and and ethics and uh hopefully our our the next generation and the the generations after that can maintain that um that standard of living i don't know if it's possible
yeah how would your best friend describe you;mm as loving nurturing um funny we laugh a lot and um caring honest things that uh i mean my best i have  well actually my best friend is it's two people it's two sisters that i grew up with and um we i for some years took care of their mother who has alzheimers before my parents got sick so i had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so um i'm considered the fourth sister so i would say that those are my best friends and and um we love each other very much it's a good relationship
aw have you ever served in the military;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes most
how long ago were you diagnosed;mostly mm minorly depression it was more anxiety um probably um um it's probably been five or six years i mean i've had if off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager i think is when i first had started with the anxiety but
mhm;um other than that i i you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control um but now it's under control so i have a great
are they triggered by something;huh
are they triggered by something;um no i think it was what they call free [flee] float free floating anxiety more of a of of uh organic um reason for it in other words there there was a chemical imbalance 
oh;in my brain
how have you been feeling lately;i've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great um we had a  good family gatherings a little stressed because um we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out um my dad is really sick um and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throws of that and um so that's a big big change but i'm looking forward to it because really don't want my parents to be alone as they get they're in their eighties so as they get closer to death i want to have my family there with them
i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um not easy usually all of my life i think i've always i mean i'm not i've always had um at least i wake up at least once in the middle of the night
why;um to go to the bathroom basically
oh;and uh other than that i mean no now i sleep well i mean other than that i sleep well but sometimes if i wake up like really early in the morning then i can't go back to sleep  i'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep idepends on what my schedule is and if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors
that sucks;yeah sometimes it does
what are you like when you don't sleep well;mm probably basically the same i think i might complain a bit like oh i'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but um i think overall probably the same my kids know i'll be i'll tell me kids oh i'm really tired and they'll understand my older daughter will be really helpful
okay;they my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that so you know they may pitch in a little bit more
uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh not really not not no not really not anything significant
do you feel like therapy is useful;huh
do you feel like therapy is useful;um actually yes i do i do feel like therapy is useful
tell me more about that;um well uh we had a situation with my daughter um she also suffers from anxiety and um we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently we're about to finish a group with her that was a six month um uh group for d_b_t it's called and it's like a  it's the first time they it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and um it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how to you know actual physical and mental um strategies to keep your uh keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or you know in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so um that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and i both have been going with our daughter and it's been really um really informational and really helpful i think
that's so good to hear what got you to seek help;oh my daughter was um she was in a bad way she was you know suffering a lot and we knew it and um we acted on it that's all
that's great when was the last time you felt really happy;um like really joyful and happy i would say probably when probably it would be in israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the at the in knaan
aw; uh so um you know where the wedding of kana took place that was really moving and beautiful um and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day flew to israel so it was right at the same time it was beautiful
wow;very meaningful and other than that i would say you know like uh other joyful occasions have been you know like christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned eighty three on christmas eve you know that kinda thing so
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood;um um that's an interesting question i would say um once i get like things done that i need to do like if i'm have a lot of chores [ch] a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once i get them done i feel like a sense of accomplishment you know much like i mean i worked for many years in a as an administrative manager at u_c_l_a and um you know once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or if there's a lot of different things you have to meet deadlines there's uh that feeling of like yeah i got it done you know so i think that would be you know for me the most um most recent um way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished
mhm what's your dream job;dream job hm i think i've already lived it i'm also a birth doula and um
really;yeah and um so i've attended a lot of births and now i really only do it for family and friends and um it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in the birth the bringing of new life into this world so i would say that's probably was my was a dream job and i didn't know it i trained much after you know i did my managerial stuff and um was awesome it is and was awesome so i don't work at at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that i worked at is now closed but um i like i said i do it for family members
what made you decide to do that;um i attended a friend of mine's birth by accident she uh she had had the same o_b as i did with all my children and um i came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were you know close friends and her labor picked up quite a bit when i got there you know she wanted me to stay she didn't want me to leave i hadn't planned on it so that was the first birth that i had attended outside of you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that i was really interesting interested in possibly study un nurse midwifery
uh huh;but then i discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more hands on uh one on one contact with the patient which is what i like so i trained to do that at at a hospital in inglewood um about fifteen years ago 'cause my son is fifteen and he was a year old no sixteen he was a year old so um yeah and i've been
how hard is that;um well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman's in labor but uh and you know also like for me i always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that i cannot guarantee a hundred percent i'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that i don't have like back up doulas that in case i'm sick or unavailable somebody else can fill in for me so um but so far it's been that all the women that've asked me i've been able to be there for some reason so the um the uh the only one that i missed was one a friend of mine from church she wanted me to go with her second baby i was with her for her first but the labor went so fast she didn't even call me [laughter]  it was in the middle of the night she was like 
wow;two hours of labor she wouldn't even if she had called me i wouldn't have been there in time [laughter] so um
[laughter];it went really fast but other than that you know um yeah i've been been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um in all of life or in your job
whatever comes to your mind;uh probably my my own birth i mean my the birth of my own children
how did you feel in that moment;um like there's an extreme sense of joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can't explain it's it's just it's awesome after you give birth
that sounds like a great situation;and i have experienced both ways i've done both um natural and my last child was via c_section so i've had both both um experiences
mhm is there anything you regret;um i with my third child i had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when i was in labor it wasn't funny
[laughter];and um she she was not there when the doctor i mean it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water and oof my husband was there but she was not nor was the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because i only had like two contractions after that
oh no;my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great 'cause i didn't have to go through any of the labor but um i'm sure they weren't happy to fill out a lot of paper work after that
yeah;so
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;now would i give mysef for ten or twenty years ago um ten or twenty years ago i was probably more not as um relaxed not as um like i feel now at my age that um i i don't have the same concerns that i did then i don't worry about uh i don't worry at all about what people think about me i don't worry at all about what you know you know like my i noticed my daughter's oh mom you can't wear that because people are gonna say this i just say i don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that that oh mom you have to dress like this and dress like that whatever so that would probably be it the wisdom that you you achieve with age that you you see how life there are so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things
that makes sense;what are you most proud of in your life most proud of um probably my family my my husband and my my children i mean the fact that we've stayed married that we've we're an in tact family that um my kids see every day how their friends suffer who come from divorced families or single parents and they um they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so i would say that's probably it
that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities;um probably the one of my best qualities is uh being able to listen to people and being able to um not be judgmental um through the years i've had a  a lot of experience with um people with problems a lot of friends with problems people i know from church and it's just taught me that um everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and um i don't think i'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else then that's usually um to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough

why did you stop;i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot
awesome what made you decide to do that;uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and uh you know i got influenced by them
i understand how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour  there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep

okay so how are you doing today;um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human
<laughter>  i see what you mean where are you from originally;um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city
awesome what are some things you really like about l_a;um there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great 
okay what are some things you don't really like about l_a;that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too 
yeah yeah what'd you study at school;i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology
wow that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that;i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it 
nice what's your dream job;everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter>
okay do you travel a lot;i do um
what do you enjoy about traveling;i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving
wow what are some things that make you really mad;i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up
mhm what do you do when you're annoyed;vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter>
<laughter> yes how are you at controlling your temper;i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control 
that's good when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;<laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight
aww that's good what do you do to relax;um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people 
okay how close are you to your family;i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground
i see what you mean do you consider yourself an introvert;yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge 
mhm how would your best friend describe you;i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal  
that's great what are you most proud of in your life;i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that
that's so good to hear;<laughter>
have you ever served in the military;no i have not
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago 
you were very young weren't you;yes
what got you to seek help;um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help
do you still go to therapy now;i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks 
that sucks;<laughter>
do you feel like therapy's useful;uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back
yeah how have you been feeling lately;lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california 
yeah that sounds really hard how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep
okay what are you like when you don't sleep well;um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile
i see when was the last time that happened;probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens  
okay when was the last time you felt really happy;uh <makes sound with mouth> really happy i mean um i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life
that's great what would you say are some of your best qualities;i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn 
okay what's one of your most memorable experiences;uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this 
wow;cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so  that was that was pretty good <laughter> 
awesome what are some things you like to do for fun;i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um <laughter> so uh i guess reading hiking um just being together with my friends doing um relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking playing with my cat
okay is there anything you regret;not that i can really think of i'm sure i've made mistakes in my life but um you know i'm still here so can't be that bad
yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;hmm um i don't know hang in there um hold on to your clothes 'cause the nineties are coming back in fashion
<laughter> what are some things that usually put you in a good mood;hmm um cloudy weather uh beautiful sunsets being in um being out in nature kind of being away from the hubub of the city getting a good grade <laughter>
cool who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;i think my boyfriend has he's just um especially the last year he's really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's  really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he's made a lot of positive changes in his life and i know that those things aren't aren't hard or aren't easy i should say um to <t> so to see someone overcome that  uh really inspired me

goodbye ;goodbye 
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this ;yes

how did you decide to do that ;well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film
that's great ;<laughter> 
when was the last time that happened ;last time i made a film just this last october made a short film 
what was it about;<laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally
mhm that sounds interesting ;thanks <laughter> 
what are some things that make you really mad ;really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad 
uh oh ;yeah 
that sucks ;<laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school 
do you find it easy to be a parent ;no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy  
yeah  what's the hardest thing about being a parent ;<sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so   
uh huh that sounds really hard ;mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it 
that's good what's the best thing about being a parent ;<sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they 
aw;yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but
<laughter> ;you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that 
yeah that's so good to hear ;hmm
what do you think of today's kids ;oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed
uh huh ;and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong
yeah i see what you mean ;hmm
what do you do when you're annoyed ;me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation 
okay  when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm

that sounds really hard ;yeah 
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;um  yeah i mean  well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing 
that's great ;yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink  
mhm;um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving 
that's good  have you been diagnosed with depression ;uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  
how hard is that yeah did you think you had a problem before you found out ;um not really 
what were your symptoms ;always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed
yeah  do you feel like therapy's useful ;i do at some point i've had some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen  
mhm;and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist
yeah i see what you mean  what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better 
mm why did you stop ;um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so 
mhm;mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know 
yeah  okay  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ;um  i can't really think of anything right now 
okay  when was the last time you felt really happy ;um  it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy 
i'm sorry to hear that ;thank you <sniffle>
what's one of your most memorable experiences ;um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that  
<laughter> <laughter> ;oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences  
wow that's great ;yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so 
yeah  is there anything you regret ;um just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so 
mhm;so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable 
that's good yeah  what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things 
yeah that makes sense  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood ;um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work  uh when i'm helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood

i see what you mean that makes sense;<laughter>
is there anything you regret;uh that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward
could you have done anything to avoid it;avoid it yeah watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem
has that gotten you in trouble;uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy 
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;uh stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen 
mm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;uh my girlfriend's been really helpful
tell me more about that;<yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and 
that's so good to hear;uh <laughter> yeah
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and uh i'm a good listener 
uh huh what are you most proud of in your life;uh well i've written about four or five books i uh my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i didn't have much of a singing voice but now i do
that's good okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;okay bye
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this;yeah
okay so how are you doing today;i'm doing okay how are you doing
that's good i'm great thanks where are you from originally;i'm originally from like a suburb <su> a suburb of l_a from the san gabriel valley
really what are some things you really like about l_a;i like the diversity i like the vibe of the city i've lived other places and it's just not as happy here i feel like i can really thrive here so i just like l_a
mhm;like all the things that are so close together then there's a lot of interesting things that totally different parts of the city just miles away from each other
yeah i see what you mean what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh don't like the traffic don't like all the cars but i can live with it i mean there's not that much i don't like
okay what'd you study at school;i studied music um vocal performance i studied music technology things like that
awesome are you still working in that;yes
what do you do now;right now um i sing in an opera company but my i do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the l_a opera so i do have a day job i work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it's really good because if i get a call i can call in and change my shift very easily so it's actually a pretty good gig
okay;and i do some uh technology gigs sometimes you know it's do some recording some live sound stuff but i'm kinda wanna get away from that do some video work sometimes but again i wanna get away from that i wanna go back to the 
why;because i find that performing more is more interesting i like being talent more than i like being crew <laughter> so i kinda wanna get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what i wanna do with my life
okay do you consider yourself an introvert;sometimes i mean per my personal life yeah so i do have a shell that i put out there to deal with people but if i'm at home you know i'd kinda rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family   don't really have too many close friends <clears throat> but yeah you know i'd rather keep to myself
uh huh how close are you to your family;uh moderately close to the family that i have left i've actually lost a lot of family in the last ten years or so
i'm sorry to hear that;but like thank you <laughter> but like uh my i'm close to my husband and you know i've got couple of cousins i talk to and my aunt that i have an aunt that i talk to a bit but it's not like we're interacting every day close together 
right;but it's somewhat close
okay what do you do to relax;mostly i sing or i read or i write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn't work but i try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in and sometimes <ss> sometimes that works sometimes it doesn't but mostly creating things um contacting my family some <so> you know through facebook or whatever
uh huh;works but mostly in my free time i create things
okay do you travel a lot;i'd like to travel more i like to travel by car a lot um i mean my idea of like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and i like to travel more um i would love to travel for work things or whatever but i don't get as much of an opportunity as i would like to to travel
what do you enjoy about traveling;seeing <see> uh particularly traveling by car seeing like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you know feeling the vibrations of the area change  i like just seeing what's out there seeing and i know that there's a bigger world outside of  where i am and where i live and my world and i like to see that
uh huh;but i like to leave that too and go back to my own world <laughter>
<laughter>;<laughter> <clears throat>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um let's see xxx a trip that i like to take is to make the drive from here to nevada whether i go all the way to vegas or just go to state line um my cousin and i would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway so we'd take those we'd just   sort of impromptu with like <li> a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that i i like making <mak> 'cause i take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren't very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how um you know the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas 
uh huh;so close to home but not but not close to home close to home but uh still a world away so that 'cause i don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever but that's just little things that kinda put things back in perspective and and clear my head and things like that i mean 'cause there's sort of a sense of meditation and zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway
yeah;so i i like i like doing that
i see what you mean cool when was the last time that happened;the last time that happened was may of last year that's the last time i was able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who's ten years younger than i am and we kinda grew up like sisters and i was about to move away from the inland empire which is where they live so they kinda took me on a last hurrah and we drove up to vegas and looked around and came back 'cause i actually lived in vegas for awhile but i didn't like it so they kinda i showed <show> showed them some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was you know an overnight trip but we were driving the entire time <laughter> so
wow;it was kind of an interesting
what are some things that make you really mad;uh things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals people who can't fight back and they're mean to them just because they can't fight back   and i actually like to see people who are strong <st> as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate
yeah;or what have you so i think that's one thing that's makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason you know not people <pe> for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it just that kinda really just makes me mad
uh huh okay what do you do when you're annoyed;when i'm annoyed i'll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situation insists on following me then i'll wind up lashing out somehow either   you know verbally just cutting 'em with a quip or you know i mean i i rarely just i rarely will yell at somebody but i'll try to you know if i'll try to walk away and defuse it if that doesn't work then i'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me <laughter> that usually works 
has that gotten you in trouble;not in like legal trouble or anything because usually i'll find a way to get them to leave me alone um so there's not really like big trouble but 'cause i think 'cause it's it it is off-putting and it's not expected <exp> the expected reaction and that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction 'cause i know that will work and get people away from me so it's not really in trouble and if 
uh huh;it's is trouble it's usually trouble that it's from their the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because it's usually a situation i can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone you know i don't i i'll walk away from it
okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;uh the last time i argued with somebody like person <per> like a person <per> like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my
whatever comes to your mind;uh the last thing i can think of was i argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law 'cause she's got dementia and so we one of the reasons we came out here from the inland empire was to take care of her 'cause she won't go anywhere but l_a i mean she is like hardcore angelino like you know we we know we are the we're that in our nature but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere <laughter> but um so we came out here to take care of her 
yeah;and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and i want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is 'cause she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process 
yeah;but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what she wants 'cause he's a mama's boy like i am i'm a mama's girl even though i've lost my mom like four years ago i'm still a mama's girl and i'll still <st> and i still and i know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much and that's what they want so you wanna get it for 'em and because you know they you know that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it  and you wanna do that for them now like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about somebody you feel deserves it but it's kinda dangerous for her you know and i don't want things <thi> something to happen to her yet i want her to remain who she is for as long as she can 'cause i know it the disease that she has is gonna erase who she is eventually
yeah;and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her twenty four hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves 'cause it's not that bad but it's getting where she really shouldn't <shou> has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most the time with her and i go back to our house and i it gets stressful and it gets annoying because i do i handle the outside things i run the errands i take her to the store things like that he does the day to day things makes sure she has <ha> she eats makes sure she you know has clean clothes things like that
uh huh;so i mean it's a partnership it's a it's a dual effort it's very much a dual effort but i would like her to move in with us so that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling screaming argument but lively discussion <laughter> you know than debate
i see that sounds really hard;meh it's not insurmountable i mean life's not gonna be easy ever and if it is that's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life it's not gonna be easy but you deal with it and you you move on
yeah who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;uh the most positive influence i think have been probably my mother and my grandmother 'cause my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it so i mean i think i have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperment <laughter> to myself but they but they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something i can't get over
uh huh;and that you know life's gonna go on you know my mom would say to me when you're forty you're forty whether you're working at mcdonald's or doing what you want with your life and i think that was a big influence on how i lived have how i've lived my life since she's passed  
that's great is there anything you regret;i regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because i think it may have clouded some of my decisions now i do have underlying conditions and everybody in my family is diabetic and i didn't take care of that when she was the last year of her life 'cause i was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home
yeah;so i didn't eat right i didn't take my insulin right um i wound up making myself insulin resistant that that year just 'cause my blood sugar was so high for eh like a year eating just horrible foods when i did eat so it really took a toll and i really actually made myself very sick  and i'm wondering well if i didn't if i would've taken care of myself and i had my head on completely straight and my my vision <vi> my vision and my thoughts weren't completely <complete> weren't clouded would i have made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed 'em and when she needed me to be to step in and make the decisions for her because she  uh wound up having a health catastrophe 'cause she had kidney well she had kidney damage that wound up being kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that so she wound up having
wow;sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wound up having a stroke at like fifty one she had had a small stroke and it just kinda went down from there so i'm thinking well if i didn't if i had taken care of better care of myself would i have been able to take better care of her and i know there wasn't anything i would've been able to do to prevent her death but what if i if i would i have been be able to make it easier on her if i would have taken care of myself and that's like one huge regret that i have
yeah do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself;oh i know i am <laughter> but xxx it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that i care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and i know other people i can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings and they can't you know be what i want them to be and i know they're not going to be but i still have you know my ideals and i want the way i want everything to go and i want everybody that i care about to be happy and to be able too  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but i know 'cause they're other beings and i know i'm not gonna be able to do that for them and they're not gonna be able to do that for me but it's still my ideals <laughter> so i have to sometimes have to look at it and go well
mhm;is this what i want because i want it or what is what they want and what's their <thei> is it their decision or mine and it's usually it's theirs and i know it's theirs so i so if you really care about somebody you're just gonna support them and go with them but 
yeah;it's still kinda hard <laughter> for for me and know i gotta get over it
yeah what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago;um ten or twenty years ago probably to have been more assertive in starting my own life because i wound taking care of my mother i mean she got sick literally the weekend i graduated from college <laughter> and i had a job lined up and i had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her and i think i would've been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside  the house in addition to caring for her getting uh my own job history my own credit history thing like things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about ten years
uh huh;so i think i i probably would've done that um but i tell myself just do that you keep who you are and learn to separate your you who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of of yourself that's probably what i would've and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself that's probably the advance advice of what i would give myself   
mhm;ten years ago <laughter>
okay have you ever served in the military;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no but probably 'cause i haven't gone to a doctor about it <laughter> 'cause i don't wanna know and i mean it's not i know there've been times in my life where i've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but i'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment and of it gets <ge>
can you give me an example of that;um after my mother had died i mean it'd been this long battle for a year that we lost and i didn't know if i if i was to blame for that it's like logically i knew i wasn't but how could i convince myself of that um two weeks after she died i wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because i didn't take care of myself for a year and i figured oh i'm thirty years old if you know whatever i do to myself i can get over no <laughter> turns out no <laughter> but um i mean i wound up having to take more medication because of that uh it's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression 'cause so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter all of a sudden i didn't it's like the rug was pulled out my like bottom fell out of my world after that so
yeah;that was the prilly pretty much sent me into a deep depression um i almost got divorced because of it because i just didn't want anything anymore  so and i was i being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point and i started getting very distant from him just pushing everything away just you know figuring well what am i gonna do with the rest of my life now and it it's been a fight you know you mean there times when no i couldn't get up just stay in bed and sleep all day you know but then realizing that when my mother died i had four cats to look after two are mine two are hers and so i wound up adopting the two that were hers i mean well they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you know own own supplies
uh huh;i took that responsibility of doing it for them so that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not i was gonna get up and provide for them i mean i could go without eating i could go without taking care of myself but they couldn't
yeah;they didn't you know so they eh they actually got me up and and made me go out and face things even though i didn't want to didn't just didn't just kinda wanted to curl up and die but that would've been my choice not theirs and they i mean what would happen to them if i wasn't there to take care of them they would've been you know sent to a shelter or whatever probably  and maybe they would've not been readopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for  for me i mean for me making selfish decisions  
mhm;so it's like i need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed <laughter> so <s> and that's actually been a motivating factor is to to 'cause i've figured out that if it was just me i'd be able to live without a lot of stuff i mean i would be able to live in my car if i wanted it wouldn't be a big deal i wouldn't care   as long as i was doing what i wanted with my life but i have a family to look after now  so i have to go out and do things 
yeah;you know i i have to go out and look for legitimate work you know day you know day job i have to you know   but i'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what i wanna do with my life but yet i have to take care of my family so i'm   been working on on a balance of the two
how hard is that ;very <laughter> but it's worth it i mean  it would be very i'd have a lot less things to worry about if i just lived in my car and said forget it <laughter>  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it's it's difficult but you have to do it you know if you want you want anything <anyth> if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that 
yeah;and i and and i know that  but  it it gets hard sometimes you do wanna give up  but then  it's like well what's the alternative  i mean i don't think i could live a comfortable life  'cause if i did i wouldn't do anything <laughter> i have to be slightly uncomfortable or i'm not gonna do anything with myself i'm just gonna  be content to just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with my cats or whatever  and i wouldn't get anything done 
i see how have you been feeling lately ;uh very  anxious and nervous and i mean what if  i don't find  enough you know enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if um  you know what what if i can't   keep a semblance of stability in my life and it it's actually hard work to be stable <laughter> and i know it's hard work to be stable but  what you know it's just eh a lot of what ifs  and and i don't think it's things that haven't happened and it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened and i know that  but it still happens <ha> it still creeps in  so that's actually  a source of  anxiety  but then you try to let the anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but i i i know it it's a cycle
that's good ;and i'll go from being really anxious and oh my god what am i gonna do what am i gonna do to saying okay what is the fundamental thing i need to take of here  i mean what <wha> what is just extraneous and what can <c> what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue 
mhm;and so  figure out how to figure things out that way and then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit but then something'll pop up and the what ifs will come up again  mm i'll have to  uh  figure it out again <laughter> but i know it's a cycle i know um what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it   you get over it pretty quickly you get through it 
yes when was the last time you felt really happy ;the last time i felt really happy i don't know zz um i  huh <laughter> that's a good question that actually <ac> that actually surprisingly stumped me  because i do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much sometimes just kinda eh in the middle um really like overjoyously happy i don't know  i i'm not i can't think of <o> of when that happened
okay  how would your best friend describe you ;i don't know you don't know  perceptions of other people i mean  probably as somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid back and you know  handles things as they come but i don't see myself as that   at all and it's a it
what would you say are some of your best qualities ;probably that i can think on my feet and i'm not afraid to  hussle my butt off and do whatever i have to to survive and get things done  um that  and i can do it creatively and i try to  strive for balance  probably  probably the best things about me <laughter> 
uh huh that's great what are you most proud of in your life ;that i'm doing basically what i want with my life which even though it's not all easy it's not  um you know i'm not financially well off or anything it's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives 'cause i have an aunt that i really don't talk to  who and the reason why i don't talk to her is because she's always miserable i mean she's got a career that she  it's more of a job that she fell into  'cause my older aunt uh loves animals but didn't wanna be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer 
uh huh;and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time   but her hands <ha> you know she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had um the actually my cousin's father went and kinda stole all the money from her business so she lost her business   and she kinda she retired early 'cause between that and the arthritis she wound up retiring early 
uh oh ;she employed my younger aunt who was still a dog groomer but she hates it   and it's like change your life if you hate your life so much change it 
yeah;and the thing <thi> the thing i'm most proud of is  yeah i'm not as financially well off as she is but i'm doing what i want with my life you know i can  be creative i can have creative people around me people who i actually like to talk to around me  people i actually like in my life and  be happy with that  and i see a lot of people who aren't  and it it gives me a sense of of maybe a a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say i'm not like that 
yeah ;and i'm actually doing what i want even though there's sacrifices i'm still fundamentally doing what i want with my life now
mhm that's so good to hear  okay i think i've asked everything i need to ;thank you <laughter> okay 
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me ;thank you <laughter>

mhm yeah ;yeah 
what do you think of today's kids ;excuse me 
what do you think of today's kids ;<sigh> what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it
hmm yeah i see what you mean  what are some things that make you really mad;<sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  uh <sigh> it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me that can be very frustrating
mhm;uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too  
can you give me an example of that ;uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean 
mm;yeah 
what do you do when you're annoyed ;<sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but uh i'm learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it
yeah ;yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me
how are you at controlling your temper ;oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well 
okay when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about ;uh  i i don't know i think it probably was my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do
yeah ;yeah 
i understand  how close are you to your family ;we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them  
that's good ;yeah very good 
when was the last time you felt really happy ;uh  this morning <laughter>  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirit's in connection with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good  
that's so good to hear ;yes 
how have you been feeling lately ;uh <sigh> up and down you know up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well
yeah  tell me more about that ;uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter>
that's great ;yeah 
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am 
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;uh yes i have  see i had to be
like what ;uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry 
mhm yeah;and i have to take 
how hard is that ;excuse me ma'am 
how hard is that ;uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you 
okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep ;it's very seldom  uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so 
are they triggered by something ;<sigh> i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran  at the uh v_a about the situation now about the p_t_s_d basically right now 
yeah  what got you to seek help ;excuse me ma'am 
what got you to seek help ;uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help 
mhm;and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me 
is going to a therapist helping you ;and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it  
yeah;and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah 
i understand is going to a therapist helping you ;somewhat yes it is somewhat 
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy ;'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit 
that's good ;yeah 
do you have disturbing thoughts;it's a good thing excuse me ma'am
do you have disturbing thoughts;no no not really 
okay  how would your best friend describe you ;my best friend 
mhm;uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me
mhm;yeah they see something in me they wish that they had  
do you consider yourself an introvert ;excuse me ma'am
do you consider yourself an introvert ;uh can you be a little bit more specific 
let's come back to that later ;oh okay 
what do you do to relax ;uh books crossword puzzles uh walking that's about it 
okay  is there anything you regret ;i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future 
yeah  mhm i see what you mean ;yeah 
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;<sharp inhale> uh <sigh> more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago 
okay  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life 
can you give me an example of that ;uh <sigh> yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  
yeah  what are you most proud of in your life ;excuse me ma'am 
what are you most proud of in your life ;uh <sigh> that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it
mhm that's great  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ;oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of 'em uh  and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me 
mhm;yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going

are you still working in that ;no i'm not  i'm actually um
what do you do now ;i'm um i'm trying to be an actress 
how did you decide to do that ;it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing  
that sounds interesting  are you happy you did that ;um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful  
yeah  who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences 
how close are you to your family ;um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day 
that's good  what do you do to relax;um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax 
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep ;um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks 
are they triggered by something;um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me 
yeah ;so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well 
okay  what are you like when you don't sleep well ;um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around 
how do you cope with them ;um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so 
mhm how hard is that ;um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways  
yeah  i see have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;yes 
how long ago were you diagnosed ;um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august
what got you to seek help ;um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress 
uh huh ;um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated 
yeah  that sounds really hard ;yeah  it was 
do you still go to therapy now;i no <n> do not
why did you stop ;um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um 
uh huh;and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just 
i'm sorry to hear that ;they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um 
yeah ;yeah so um  yeah 
how have you been feeling lately ;<sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy 
that's good  when was the last time you felt really happy ;um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so
can you tell me about that ;um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um 
that's so good to hear ;yeah  thank you <laughter>
what are you most proud of in your life ;oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through 
mhm;um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so 
yeah ;um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me 
that's great;yeah 
is there anything you regret;ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;<sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself 
yeah ;so if
mhm;had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so 
i see what you mean ;yeah 
what are some things that make you really mad ;<sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um 
mhm;i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad

yeah  what were your symptoms ;there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot 
i'm sorry  how have you been feeling lately ;i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things 
yeah  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before 
do you still go to therapy now ;no 
why did you stop ;mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while 
that sounds really hard ;uh sometimes 
do you feel like therapy's useful ;i do  yes it is
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep ;it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep
are they triggered by something ;i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep
mhm;mhm
how do you cope with them ;um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping 
i see ;it
what are you like when you don't sleep well ;tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused 
okay  when was the last time you felt really happy ;i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays 
i'd love to hear all about it ;uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it 
okay  how would your best friend describe you ;how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them 
aw  that's great ;<laughter> 
is there anything you regret;um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff 
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be 
yeah ;yeah 
that makes sense  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ;um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball
awesome  what are you most proud of in your life ;um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well  
that sounds like a great situation  okay i think i've asked everything i need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  goodbye ;goodbye

that's good do you travel a lot;no i'm more of a creature of habit
okay do you consider yourself an introvert;um yes
why;uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things
mhm what do you do to relax;um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs
cool what are some things that make you really mad;um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter>
yeah how are you at controlling your temper;um pretty good you know sometimes <so>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that

how do you know them;um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends
okay what do you do when you're annoyed;um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually
how hard is that;um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion 
yeah i understand what's one of your most memorable experiences;um um probably spending time with my family in new york
how close are you to your family;very close

do you still go to therapy now;um not currently i i did about like six months ago
why did you stop;um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change
yeah i'm sorry to hear that;it's okay <laughter>
do you feel like therapy is useful;um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat>
that's good what were your symptoms;um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life

what are you like when you don't sleep well;um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter>
okay when was the last time you felt really happy;um probably christmas time when i was with my family

uh huh that's good what would you say are some of your best qualities;um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter> 
mhm;um

goodbye;goodbye <laughter>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this ;yes 
okay so how are you doing today  ;i'm doing pretty good <laughter> 
that's good where are you from originally ;i'm from oklahoma 
really ;mhm yup oklahoma city 
what are some things you really like about l_a;uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter>
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter> 
why'd you move to l_a;um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean  
what'd you study at school ;i studied psychology and minored in art 
are you still working in that ;um no not at the moment 
what do you do now;um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law 
what's your dream job ;my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter>
what do you do to relax ;to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends 
what are some things that make you really mad ;things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter> 
what do you do when you're annoyed ;when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything 
how are you at controlling your temper ;um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it 
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about ;<sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues 
how close are you to your family ;i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time 
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways 
what's one of your most memorable experiences ;oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter>
do you travel a lot;yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool 
what do you enjoy about traveling ;uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool 
have you ever served in the military ;no i have not served in the military <laughter> 
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;nope
have you been diagnosed with depression ;no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah  
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep ;lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me  
what are you like when you don't sleep well ;i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function 
how have you been feeling lately ;i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter>
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>   
when was the last time you felt really happy ;oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter> 
how would your best friend describe you ;my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter> 
what are you most proud of in your life ;um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles 
is there anything you regret ;oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything 
what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do 
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed ;oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun 
okay i think i've asked everything i need to;cool

that sounds interesting are you still working in that ;um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment
what's your dream job;um i wanna be an osteopathic physician

mhm how have you been feeling lately ;um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working  
are they triggered by something ;um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out
i see what you mean  how do you cope with them ;um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home   
okay  how has seeing a therapist affected you ;um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started  and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you okay with this ;yes 
okay so how are you doing today  ;okay 
that's good  where are you from originally ;from here from eh from alhambra 
really what are some things you really like about l_a;uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar 
mhm what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic 
yeah i see what you mean  what'd you study at school ;i i studied art and photography
that sounds interesting how did you decide to do that ;uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it 
cool are you still working in that ;yes 
what do you do now;i'm a photographer 
nice;mhm
what's your dream job ;oh i suppose uh  um running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business 
okay  do you travel a lot;uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down 
i see how do you like your living situation ;um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager i've i do have free rent but i have to stay there a lot so 
mhm that sucks ;that part does the free rent part is very good 
what's one of your most memorable experiences ;oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences 
whatever comes to your mind ;oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though 
mhm who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life ;uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family
how close are you to your family ;uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat> 
wow;mhm
what do you think of today's kids;oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media 
yeah i understand what do you do to relax ;uh go on a walk or watch television 
mhm;or play with my computer  and uh
what are some things that make you really mad;um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna 
oh ;uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting
can you give me an example of that ;uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job 
oh no;that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting 
how do you cope with them ;uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um 
that's good ;yeah 
how are you at controlling your temper ;uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that 
mhm when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about ;um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it
that's good ;yeah 
have you ever served in the military ;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is 
mhm;uh no i have not
have you been diagnosed with depression ;yes 
how long ago were you diagnosed ;oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty
that's a long time ;yeah 
what got you to seek help ;um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist 
what were your symptoms ;um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression 
yeah  did you think you had a problem before you found out ;yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was 
do you still go to therapy now ;no
why did you stop ;uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days 
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that  
that makes sense  mhm how have you been feeling lately ;i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um
yeah ;it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed  
uh huh have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately ;uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and
yeah ;eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that 
okay  yeah is there anything you regret ;oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have
hmm what advice would you give yourself ten or twenty years ago ;um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time
uh huh ;so 
i see what you mean  what would you say are some of your best qualities ;um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so
cool;yeah

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;good how are you
i'm great thanks;i am from los angeles
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;um it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far um i like being in the city
mhm;well being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great but
yeah;you know you live with that
i see what you mean;um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um after i finished college i um uh pursued a career in retail operations
are you still doing that;uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business
what made you decide to do that;um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company
are you happy you did that;yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and it's very helpful
that's great;<laughter> well my dream job is um i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be
that sounds like a great situation;mm i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself
can you tell me about that;oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to
wow;yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it
okay;actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know
aw;um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that
yeah;it does <laughter>
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run
yeah;it is it was
tell me about your relationship with your family;um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old
wow;and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child
yeah;probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife
can you give me an example of that;uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife
yeah;i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life
i'm sorry;no not at all
have you been diagnosed with depression;no not really no
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no
that's good;no not at all
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that
that's great;the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications
that's so good to hear;well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish
how do you cope with them;just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself
mm;well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day
yeah;what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately
uh huh;probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time
yeah;it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore
mhm;um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know
uh huh;well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me
nice;and thank you
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;i am
okay;i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today
that's good;i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles
really;yes i am
what are some things you really like about l_a;i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live
yeah;thank you
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california
that sucks;it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of
mm;so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state
mhm;i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served
like what;i'm sorry
like what;uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school
nice;so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me
(laughter;<laughter> so that was a
what did you study at school;uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so
what made you decide to do that;uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so
mhm;um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past
what's your dream job;hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh
aw;you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so
yeah;probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved
okay;oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but
that's great;yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the
yeah;i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier
how are you at controlling your temper;i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties
uh huh;so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so
how did you feel in that moment;i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match
yeah;whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us
mhm;hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently
i'm sorry;thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so
i see;um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different
uh huh;and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different
yeah;yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years
why'd you decide to enlist in the military;i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies
how old were you when you joined the military;that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into
you were very young weren't you;i was but same age as everybody else that went there
did you ever see combat;uh we did nineteen eighty three
can you tell me about that;um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so
wow;that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation
why;that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit
mhm;well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana
right;grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan
what did you do after the military;uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell
how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life;um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but
mm;it was a great experience
that's good;um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well
how have you been feeling lately;i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately
okay;um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling
do you feel like therapy is useful;i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it
what got you to seek help;oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger
i understand;so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that
do you still go to therapy now;uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to
okay;yeah
how has seeing a therapist affected you;i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity
yeah;to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man
uh huh;so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good
uh huh;uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day
that's great;and i looked forward to feeling the sun so
how would your best friend describe you;uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun
mhm;i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them
yeah;so that's pretty much
has that gotten you in trouble;no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully
okay;i like to think i do
is there anything you regret;uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices

goodbye;bye bye thank you
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;sure
okay;i'm doing alright
that's good;new jersey
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;three months ago
how often do you go back to your hometown;not very often
how does it compare to l_a;uh it's much different uh i don't know it's just <laughter> it's a lot more crowded here
why did you move to l_a;to start a new life for myself
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;it wasn't very easy at all <sigh> uh it was uh it was quite rough at first but you know i'm still trying to get used to life here
what are some things you really like about l_a;i've met some good friends here um you know i love the hollywood area um and just you know the mountains are beautiful that's kinda things i love
uh huh;hmm the traffic
i understand;not really no i don't
why;just haven't had the time or the finances to
okay;digital media
that sounds interesting;well i've always loved you know <deep breath> computers and you know designing things and uh i don't know i just kinda fell into it
cool;no i dropped out
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;well i i guess my dream job would be working <deep breath> in something that uh i went to school for you know i i never really completed my education um but i guess it'd be great if i went you know back to school and you know finished you know my degree in digital media and uh you know finished and uh started working you know doing something in that field
mhm;a little bit of both you know i i can be shy at times but i like to push myself to be outgoing you know it's kind of a a struggle for me but i i don't wanna be you know in a shell so i kinda force myself to be outgoing
yeah;listen to music i uh sometimes just drive and um you know play music in my car and that helps me relax
nice;or i smoke a cigarette
like what;oh like what ooh um <laughter> just heavy metal that's all i listen to is metal
awesome;well <sigh> it depends on how high my stress level is and how angry i am but i i do my best to not get so pissed off <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;scrubbed_entry and i don't know she um she wanted me to to come and pick her up uh she was a little drunk and uh we just kinda fought over the phone all over some other things and i just ended not picking her up because of her attitude on the phone with me
that sucks;<laughter> yeah it does
what's something you feel guilty about;something i feel guilty about is uh not talking to my kids uh often or as often as i should i've just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that i i don't really have time to you know talk to my kids as much as i'd like to
yeah;you have no idea
do you find it easy to be a parent;um it's it comes natural but it's no way easy and uh it's it's the hardest job that i love to do but right now it's extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and i i made this choice to come out here to l_a and i feel bad that i don't see them you know but the reason i came out here was to better myself so i can provide for them
yeah;fear you know fear <f> just fear will you know you <y> you fear what's gonna happen to your kids you fear that something awful is gonna happen and not seeing them it brings about that fear a lot more you know and i can't i can't always be there with them i can't see them you know it it wasn't as bad when i was living in florida um and i i at least i used to see them it wasn't very often but i used to used to see them now i don't see them at all and
mhm;that's the that's the hardest thing i've had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily i don't know how long i'm gonna be here for i don't know what my future holds but the hardest thing is being so far away from them
yeah;just the the joy that they bring to me i mean i could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up i mean i eh it sucks being away from them for for so long and they're so far away and just not seeing their faces that's it's it's the worst thing ever you know but i i love to just see their faces they they just bring a smile to my face and um
mm;i don't know
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;well um i think the fact that i can get down to their level um i'm i'm a bit goofier <laughter> as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you know strict all the time sure he used to you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kinda held back a lot he a lot of his emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy
yeah;um but with me i i i'm very goofy and silly with my kids and i'm strict when i have to be but i always love to you know play around with them as much as possible you know not i don't want them to grow up too fast and that that may have been
i see what you mean;yeah
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;well <sigh> a situation that i wish i would've handled differently there's so many <laughter> uh i guess when i was still with my ex-wife in florida i wish i wouldn't have gotten so angry or i wish i wouldn't have let her get the best of my emotions she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and uh you know keep picking at me until i exploded and i allowed her to do that you know i i should've just walked away when i could and um you know not let my temper get the best of me
okay;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;uh sometimes it's hard um sometimes i just lay awake in bed <sigh> you know thinking all the things that are going through my head all the you know all the stress that i'm going through with work and you know making sure you know wondering if i'm gonna if i'm gonna be able to make you know rent you know wondering what my kids are going through you know when i'll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father you know those are some of the things that run through my head and and that keeps me up at night sometimes
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself;a little <sigh> but <sigh> you know i put myself in this situation so you know i i gotta bear with it you know i gotta you know you reap what you sow so i <sigh> i gotta deal with it in my own way
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;lately um i've been trying to not think so much about you know all that's going into my life uh i try to distract myself and that kind of gets me in a better mood you know if i'm hanging out with friends or just watch a little t_v something to get my mind off you know all the stresses in my life um
that's good;the last time i felt really happy uh was actually a couple of nights ago i went out drinking with um with a couple of my friends from work and um i don't know we just got pretty drunk and just <laughter> that kinda helped me to forget all the crap that was previously going through my head so if if i can distract myself if i can forget about all that other stuff then i'm happy <sigh>
uh huh;some of my best qualities i guess that i'm convincing <laughter> um uh i'm kind of like a i guess you would say a counselor to some people you know some of my close friends you know i may talk people into doing things that they may regret or i may i mean i'm sorry take talk people out of things that they you know may end up regretting or i may um you know just listen to people so you know eh i could say that you know i definitely you know listen to my friends and help them out in their time of need when they're going through something troubling times like like i'm going through
can you give me an example of that;scrubbed_entry uh who lives in florida you know i talk to him every now and then and he's been having troubles with his girlfriend and you know i just kind of talk to him about his problems and listen i mostly <mo> i mainly listen because you know i don't think he has anybody else to listen to you know when i was living in florida i was uh very close with him so you know he he'd always relied on me and now that i'm here in l_a i don't wanna lose that you know connection with him because i mean i've always been there for him so he um he relies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice you know about what i think you know he should do um so i think <th> i think he appreciates that and i and i'm glad that he you know relies on me for that uh he trusts me enough to tell me all that stuff
yeah;<laughter> i don't know <sigh> um sometimes i wish i wasn't so kind or generous it seems bad but sometimes i i don't know people may take advantage of me and i may not realize it and um i don't like saying no to people i like to always please people so if i can change that maybe i wish i wasn't such a people pleaser
has that gotten you in trouble;sometimes financially in trouble <laughter> <deep breath> sometimes i you know it you know help others and not you know that may make me broke sometimes yeah i may not have enough to pay bills but i feel better helping people i don't know
yeah;i regret not breaking up with my ex-wife sooner i regret <re> i regret <re>
why;because she put me through so much crap in my life and um i was always trying to be a people pleaser i was trying to please her you know trying to please my kids as much as i can by not breaking up you know the family but you know there's only so much one person can take and i i think probably if i would've left sooner i may have been happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know during all those years with her so maybe if i would've got out sooner i don't know i would've been happier i guess
i see;um it's okay to be selfish it's okay to you know think about yourself sometimes you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you then you're not thinking about yourself you're not thinking about what makes you happy and even though pleasing people may make you happy uh you have to think about yourself sometimes too and about your needs because you know you play an important role in the lives of your close family members and um in order to keep everything afloat you sometimes gotta xxx gotta worry about the one person that's you know juggling everything and holding everything up which is yourself so be a little selfish sometimes it's okay
right;<laughter> i don't even know what a weekend is anymore my ideal weekend would be locked away alone in my room watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not you know being with anybody or it could be out at a bar you know or you know watching a a metal show so i like to be alone but at times i i do wanna be out with uh with others i like you know being around people
uh huh;crazy <laughter> he thinks i'm uh i'm crazy for coming out here but i guess he would say that i'm dedicated and that i'm strong-minded and that you know whatever i set my mind to i can do it you know no matter how hard it is i'm not gonna wimp out so i mean i i really respect him for giving me his insight but uh i guess yeah i guess he would say that i'm crazy but strong-minded <laughter>
what are you most proud of in your life;my kids <sigh> you know that's the one thing that brings joy to me you know like real real joy are my kids and you know just having them in my life is is the proudest thing i can ever accomplish is just you know having them in my life and although i don't get to see them as much even <e> even when i think about them just thinking about you know how far they've gone you know what what they've accomplished in their you know in in their short time i mean eh yeah it makes me happy and i can't wait to see them again
what's one of your most memorable experiences;one of my most memorable experiences i guess that would be scrubbed_entry in florida you know going to see our uh you know our favorite band skeleton witch it was it was a great night overall you know one of the night's i'll never forget just because we'd been looking forward to it for you know so many months and you know when it finally happened it was surreal um it was it was a great night after all and overall

how did you decide to do that;um good question i've always i've always wanted to go into business um and i've always wanted to study finance but i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from college per se i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that
cool;no <laughter> well i still i still kinda use what i've learned but i i work in property management so um it still has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about so
okay;yeah
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;<laughter> that was a good one um my dream job wow i would say being a life coach

aw;yeah
that's great;yeah
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;more outgoing definitely more outgoing i'm usually um the life well it's it's weird 'cause i'm usually considered like the life of the party i'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time i can be very very quiet and to myself so yeah
okay;<laughter> right <sigh> to relax i usually listen to music i usually listen to music to relax me or i pray to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah
how are you at controlling your temper;very good very very good i used to uh i wouldn't say it was a bad temper but i was known to um go off quote on quote <laughter> not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but i'm a very very patient person but once that patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i i just go off
has that gotten you in trouble;no mm mm
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;no <sigh> the last time i argued with someone <some> wow i haven't argued with somebody in a long time um <sigh> boy mm uh i argued with my no i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him um about <sigh> xxx what was it about um we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria and he wasn't listening to it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns so um it started an argument
how did you feel in that moment;uh very uh i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very kinda like i was losing control like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this this uh you know i won't call it a blur but i'm very witty and quick with what i say so i will instantly say something that you know up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across
uh huh;yeah
tell me about your relationship with your family;um i have three brothers one one younger two older i'm very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends um <sigh> my brothers are great um love 'em to death uh my father eh he's moreso out of the picture

what's something you feel guilty about;<deep breath> hmm <sigh> i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty type <laughter> i don't feel guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i definitely own up to what i do i'm not one to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel guilty for anything i do yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty
okay;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;<deep breath> pretty pretty easy um pretty easy at <a> at yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i'm reading <laughter> when i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read even when it's past my bed time but now i'm trying to work on waking up much earlier then when i am now and that's kind of a struggle <st> a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so
how have you been feeling lately;good um i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally i have a very very happy disposition and so no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going i don't allow myself to go to that place
have you been diagnosed with depression;nah no
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;sorry <sigh> mm <sigh> thoughts i would say well <we> it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes but i'd say moreso behaviors learning how to let go of past decisions maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life um i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what would've how would life be now no so the those are some games i play but other than that
yeah;that's it
is there anything you regret;hmm <laughter> regret uh no no mm mm there isn't anything i regret
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<sigh> ten to twenty years ago i would say don't be afraid of who you are um be authentic um more importantly with yourself
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;hmm erase from my memory uh boy that's a good one <sigh> hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father
can you tell me about that;maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field
wow;so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year
wow;in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though
uh huh;yeah
what would you say are some of your best qualities;hmm i'm very um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person um i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly and um yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of that sort of uh <tisk> um personality trait
cool;yeah
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;wish i was taller <laughter> um uh besides my height hmm i wish ah maybe i don't know if it's uh be more i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes
mhm;i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me
mm;that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on
yeah;<laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone who's funny crazy um objective um loyal um ambitious hardworking um mean <laughter> when i just make jokes she says you're so mean but um
why;just <sigh> i just i <laughter> i i just like to i joke around all the time and so um we were right now we're actually planning um uh a friend of mine or a friend of ours um a baby shower i'm giving her some ideas and there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone i don't talk to or hang out with we used to be really close but i don't really talk to that person but i don't mind them being there so she also talked about having <havi> celebrating her birthday also at kinda like after the baby shower and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we really <rea> didn't do anything for and i'm like well if we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person xxx birthday's passed
yeah;and i said you know what just why <wh> don't we celebrate everybody's birthday <laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays
(laughter;and then <laughter> that's when that's when she said you're so mean <laughter> but she was laughing about it so yeah
that's good;yeah
what are you most proud of in your life;uh <sigh> most proud of in my in my life <deep breath> uh <sigh> i would say being there for my family being being a a mentally and emotionally strong person family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lotta times i've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and everything make sure <su> everything <everythi> make sure everything goes accordingly um so i'd say more than anything making sure i was there for my family
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;yeah
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;oh okay thank you
goodbye;bye have a good one
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
so how are you doing today;i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay
i'm sorry to hear that;i was born in annapolis maryland
really;on the east coast
why did you move to l_a;originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often
how hard is that;it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard
yeah;depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but
okay;um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess
mhm;um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed
cool;um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing
mm;well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me
uh huh;it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good
yeah;good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i
(laughter;i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument
okay;um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough
hmm;well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different
yeah;things being how they were
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself;i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there
yeah;well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better
that's good;um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um
mhm;i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet
are they triggered by something;they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it
that sucks;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now
mhm;um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad
okay;um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know
how did you feel in that moment;in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now
yeah;um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough
okay;uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming
okay;and then there's you <laughter>
(laughter;right
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing
right;yeah
how have you been feeling lately;um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge
yeah;yeah
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so
uh huh;um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world
mhm;oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah
awesome;um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;thank you
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;<sniffle> yeah i'm okay with it
okay;um i'm okay i'm okay um i guess
that's good;scrubbed_entry i'm basically an l_a kinda guy
cool;cool
what are some things you really like about l_a;um you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot uh i like the girls here you know um i like uh let's see i don't like the traffic you know but um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't wanna be anywhere else
uh huh;i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know that's always kinda you know crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible about l_a it's always expensive and um you know i really don't like <sigh> i really don't like you know the the like it just seems like um l_a's one of those places where like you're you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down in the you know the ghettos you know
yeah;i have i've been to a couple places um uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that
mhm;um nothing i'm doing in right now
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh i like getting away from um <laughter> the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here
yeah;uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study
are you still working in that;i was i was but i lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh geez it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again uh
yeah;<laughter> well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um you know i kinda regret that you know
that sucks;<laughter> tell me about it
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter>
yeah;i guess um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar um
nice;uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know
okay;<sniffle>
how are you at controlling your temper;um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it i kinda close down and shut you know shut off for a little bit
mhm;geez um you know it doesn't happen too often maybe with my wife you know we were probably something silly who knows who knows
what's something you feel guilty about;um the thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um there are things that like you know um i call minor sins you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty
can you give me an example of that;um let's see i guess sometimes you know um you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know
mhm;well that's a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way
uh huh;well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly
aw;um uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um that get along with me pretty well actually you know
that's so good to hear;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby um the only problem i have i think is i feel like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good
that's good;<sniffle>
how have you been feeling lately;well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but um you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess
yeah;well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not
right;you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem like <laughter> like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs
mhm;i xxx it's you know it's it's probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry
yeah;i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with
have you been diagnosed with depression;no no <grumble>
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;man <sigh> uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know
uh huh;well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my <m> my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad and like things are so um rough that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um <laughter> <sigh> do things
yeah;<sniffle>
is there anything you regret;the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh
right;i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't wanna get away from but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome
yeah;ugh <sigh> i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like
yeah;i'm pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh <sigh> i don't know
okay;oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends but it's the same time i i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just
mm;um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduating from college you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean um running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim so they're like half merits you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further but um you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like that um i've seal real new no life <l> lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done

yeah;uh
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i don't know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not
mhm;yeah
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um <laughter> nothing i think <laughter> um like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and it'ts okay you know i'm okay with it whatever it just i'm not gonna i'm i can't change myself for the likings of other people <laughter> i have only one body and one life so yeah
uh huh;yeah that's it
is there anything you regret;uh just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know i you learn from that you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;um just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know the only thing you can't um i don't know you can't you know go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going yeah <laughter>
yeah;um i don't know um that's pretty huh most proud of i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm you know i try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can
how hard is that;very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know
mhm;so yeah
how would your best friend describe you;um you know loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i don't know i guess that's what they say <laughter> i i just you know that's them like you know but that's what at least what i try to be you know at least i try to give a the best foot forward always as much as possible you know even sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like uh you know you know i just i don't wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know
yeah;yeah
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;um <laughter> my ideal weekend usually i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you know sometimes if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat
that's so good to hear;yeah
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;awesome
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;thank you you're welcome <laughter>
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah
okay;i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you
that's good;uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley
really;yeah
what are some things you really like about l_a;uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too
cool;<laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine
uh huh;wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun
what do you enjoy about traveling;well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um
yeah;so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age
yeah;so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it
awesome;uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax
uh huh;i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing
okay;something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true
i see what you mean;um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened
yeah;it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck
okay;well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven
mhm;and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later
yeah;i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
is there anything you regret;well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place
mm;um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should
when was the last time that happened;uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh>
yeah;mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun
nice;uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we
aw;we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah
that's so good to hear;yeah thank you <laughter>
how would your best friend describe you;uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh
(laughter;i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans
mhm;mm uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um hmm <tisk> well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that
mhm;no problem have a good day thank you

do you find it easy to be a parent;um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter>
yeah;so
how do you cope with them;how do i cope <deep breath>
yeah;um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem
mm;it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face
can you give me an example of that;um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so
(laughter;yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter>
okay;the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter>
that sounds really hard;yeah
do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself;yeah <laughter> definitely
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily
yeah;into a different person <laughter>
uh huh;so
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;say it again
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;who's someone that's a positive influence
yeah;um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that
okay;okay
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so
uh huh;yeah that's about it
how are you at controlling your temper;<sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm
that sucks;it does <laughter>
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that
oh no;yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter>
right;yeah
how did you feel in that moment;um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter>
yeah;um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter>
hmm;yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing>
yeah;and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm
yeah;i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad
what got you to seek help;um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard
i understand;did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what
what were your symptoms;oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying>
do you still go to therapy now;yes i do i try
do you feel like therapy is useful;do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um
that's good;yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life
mhm;um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing
that's good;with life life yeah
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter>
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um
uh huh;but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;something i've read xxx
whatever comes to your mind;okay i like to go to u_s_c they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices so i like to go out to <t> to their events and i usually enjoy those
awesome;um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings
wow;and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter>
mhm;my son <laughter>
how would your best friend describe you;i don't have any friends
what would you say are some of your best qualities;my best qualities um <sigh> i'm smart i'm good-looking um i'm really um and like a hard worker i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement um that's all i can think of right now <laughter> okay
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
goodbye;goodbye press the buzzer now
yes;<synch>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;uh doing okay doing okay
that's good;uh north carolina
really;yep
when did you move to l_a;uh almost four years ago
wow;um i graduated college had an internship out here uh for a production company so i started doing that with a group of friends and then got work after that and enjoyed the city so much and have been working out here since
cool;yep
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh probably three <th> at the most three times a year maybe twice usually the holidays maybe one random trip in there
that's good;mhm
how does it compare to l_a;um uh it's l_a's only now just starting to become home to me in the sense of that respect where like uh going home was going home now going home's like going back to see my family and seeing some friends um but um i i feel more i feel more like i belong in los angeles than i do back at home
uh huh;uh the food um the weather goes without saying uh i the <th> i like the resources there i like feeling um i like that uh the things that i wanna do uh are much easier much more accessible out here than they would be in north carolina so it i feel like i'm uh uh i'm able to uh pursue eh a lot of my passions ambitions in a much more functional and realistic way living in los angeles than i am in north carolina
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh i mean the cost of living isn't great but at the same time too i always kind of tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much um resources <resour> so many resources out here so uh it's not even expensive as new york or boston so uh it's not the worst but um uh and also i mean it is a little bit annoying that every time i do wanna go home it's a flight not a drive i can't i mean conceivably <con> really conceivably drive home for the holidays 'cause it's about a three or four day adventure and just not practical so it's uh unfortunate that i'm so far away in that respect but i can't really change geography
yeah;uh <laughter> <laughter> i studied uh history and uh media studies and production
are you still working in that;uh yes i work as a freelance writer and producer
how did you decide to do that;um in college i realized i was pretty good at it and uh i knew there was a way to monetize that and i came out here and uh worked a little bit uh in the uh public sector in trying to you know just doing those jobs that way and realized i could make more money have more control over my schedule and my life if i did it freelance so i've been doing it now for a little over a year now
that's great;i do um i love traveling i try to uh go somewhere new for a good period of time about every uh seven to eight months just try to mix up things so i was in barcelona just recently and i'm planning on going to um either vietnam or even back to europe in next couple months so
awesome;mhm
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh i enjoy the break from routine i think that uh while it's nice to wake up and kind of have a vague idea where your day's going uh after a few months you can get very much kinda caught up in that and you uh pigeonhole i guess your thought process your expectations for the day and i love going to a foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything i do that day is gonna be brand new and will be different than what i would be doing if i was in los angeles or and um our own routine so i i'm a big fan of that and i love the food so it's great to just eat um a lot of food that i love in the places where they were originally created
mhm;uh yeah sure i went to uh barcelona uh like i said a few uh months ago and that was mainly because i had a friend who was living there for uh six or seven months and she kept asking me to come out and uh i finally i was at a point <p> point in work where i'd been working so much for months on end that i felt like i deserved a break so i went there for two weeks and yeah it was one of the healthiest smartest things i've done in awhile so i mm reminded me again how uh how important it is for me at least to uh to travel and to get out of the world
that's so good to hear;i'm very outgoing i uh love talking to people and conversing even virtual people oop i lost ya
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;um to relax i uh listen and play music a lot i like to read uh i like to go see movies uh cook i cook a lot so i enjoy cooking um uh my <m> my girlfriend and i are uh currently separated by distance um so i haven't seen her in weeks and that can be very uh sad obviously so i'll talk with her as much as i can but uh but yeah just uh um uh pretty simple tastes
okay;yep <participant is talking to rachel who has entered the room to fix a problem with ellie>
(laughter;<laughter> this is awkward isn't
how are you at controlling your temper;um i don't really have much of a temper so uh very good i guess i don't really get angry easily or quickly and uh when i do i'm usually aware of it enough that i can kinda formulate how i feel and why i'm feeling that way and what i want to be done about it so uh so it's pretty i guess i'm a pretty easygoing guy in that respect
that's good;<sigh> uh honestly it was probably something petty over like uh misremembering when uh something was done or like a a date on something or like a a a fact probably wasn't anything emotionally fueled uh and it was just about yeah i think it was probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to san francisco and it wasn't even an argument as much as just the other person thinking the other person's misremembering so um in you know small or big situation it's very difficult for me to actually feel enraged uh i guess in the classical sense of the word
okay;um <sigh> i'm trying to think i'm not one one for regrets um um i just recently did a uh uh a project like a a film and uh the subject matter had a little bit to do with like an ex-girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it uh i made a point i to i didn't wanna send it to her directly 'cause i didn't want her to think that i was doing to xxx her face but i did send it to her brother just because he enjoys my work and always says he wants to see stuff and i um uh maybe that <tha> she might've could've misconstrued that as being passive-aggressive i don't know um but um but yeah i mean that's something i i thought about but i don't really regret it as much as like maybe i could've just let uh everyone <ever> everyone else who i wouldn't wasn't necessarily sure about if i should do stumble upon it as opposed to me directing it to them so just my thoughts there
yeah;<sigh> <laughter> hardest decision i've ever had to make <deep breath> ah um <sigh> uh it was actually probably uh probably that uh ah i don't even wasn't even a hard decision with like i said with that the the same ex-girlfriend that i mentioned of it was probably hard because uh i knew i had to uh
right;break up with her after some stuff happened and um it was difficult 'cause i cared about her a great deal but also same tune it wasn't hard to arrive at the conclusion that i had to uh to uh break up with her but at the same time too it was not uh uh the easiest thing to kinda go through that process it's getting on a rollercoaster that you're very much aware of how mm terrible or frightening it's gonna be but you know you have to get on the rollercoaster so uh so yeah i'd say that's probably of recent memory
what made you decide to do that;ugh just a abundance of <laughter> reasons that uh this person was probably not the uh best person for me so uh like i said it was a it was i didn't have to uh i didn't have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out um it was pretty clear sign and i have no regrets about doing it now um i uh yeah i feel very strongly then about it and i felt i still feel very strongly that i made the right choice now
okay;um <sigh> it can be it can be tough there be <b> they'll be i feel like it's either if i if i've exhausted myself during the day between work and you know i've i've started exercising again which is a huge help but um but i'd say that it's i kind of when i get into bed at night i never know how it's gonna go sometimes it's uh sometimes i'll wake up within an hour of falling asleep and i can't go back to sleep or um i'll just yeah periodically keep getting up and up um so it's something that's gotten a little better in the last few weeks but uh yeah um like i said especially having my uh my current girlfriend uh not around like i said she's a very big source of comfort around so like that uh um but she travels a lot for work so it's something to have to adjust to and uh uh sleep can be can some that suffers from that but uh in the same respect i'm not someone who actually i feel like i don't need too much sleep i if i can get if i can get four to six hours i'm in pretty good shape that day so
how have you been feeling lately;um uh little anxious i guess uh little more <mo> more just um uh i just whenever i get off of a assignment uh there's always just the question like what am i what's going on next and uh so far i don't have the next um project lined up so it's always that nervousness um in the past something usually does come up so you have the precedent of it usually working out but until it does you're always a little um uh anxious and it can be depressing 'cause it's like uh um you know i've chosen a very much a lifestyle that while i get to have a lot of control and autonomy over my life uh it also is all on me in order to do it and you know sometimes i'm i um i'm very jealous of the idea of people just waking up going to an office for eight hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people or or company um carrying them through when um it's a little tough whereas like me if i have an off day or if i'm a sick day um that no work gets done <laughter> you know i'm a small business that has one employee
uh huh;how do i cope with them um i assume you mean i guess uh people i work with how do i cope with the uh maybe the better answer would be how do i cope with that lifestyle and just i got much <m> uh much more used to it something i'm still learning and figuring out how to how to handle uh as far as not just like i know the the how rewarding the work is when i do it but it's also figuring out what's the most efficient way to live the life and you know how do i uh what's the appropriate way to budget finances what's the uh expectation i should have for myself in a given year what's realistic what's hopeful um and that's something that i'm sure will take years and years to do but i feel like as long as i'm getting better at it then uh it's progress right
yeah;uh yes uh definitely once and then probably i if i would've gone back uh um i was gone in high school probably it would've been second time but um but yeah i've been diagnosed with depression once so i feel like it's one of those things that uh is something i have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know um i feel like i'm a pretty happy person for the most part but um uh has they i hate as annoying as it is but like they say like with people who are very creative or people who do a lot of stuff with the mind it tends to follow and i get that it's a self-esteem thing 'cause it's so hard to feel um so hard <har> or so easy i should <shou> suppose to get in your own head about that
mhm;uh this was within a year so i probably was feeling uh symptoms having been there before it was kinda easy to figure out like ah you know it's kinda happening again so i feeling uh the symptoms again uh uh and going through those emotions and feeling like okay at first i was kinda hoping it would be something i could kind of work through myself but um i realized it was just stupid for me to try to fight the battle on my own so i went and um started seeing a therapist
what were your symptoms;uh uh really bad this is when i i just couldn't sleep at all like i would get maybe an hour of sleep a night at best um i wasn't sleeping at all had just no <sigh> uh no no drive to do anything whether it was you know as simple as brushing my teeth or cleaning my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that it's like oh this is all in my head and it's not even like a a symptom so um uh yeah just a general just a general malaise that comes with depression
do you still go to therapy now;uh no i just finished up uh finished up i mean since i didn't graduate or anything <anyth> like that but i got to a point where i felt like uh um i kind of talked through as much as i could talk through and i'd moved on eh in other places in my life it was in kind of a good good work xxx especially like i said i was i was working on something i really cared about um i'm now with someone i care about greatly and uh um there's such a potential opportunity for me to not even have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that uh i felt like therapy was not necessary and also i just didn't really have the time to with as much work goes on so
do you feel like therapy is useful;oh i definitely i think having someone you can confide in uh who isn't your friend or your family member who won't you know have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to them or anything like that is definitely a a something beneficial i can't imagine how anyone couldn't benefit from having that on a somewhat of a routine basis
okay;um <sigh> i don't know i'm i'm a firm <f> kind of a firm believer that the all those things like those things that kinda can haunt you are also there for a reason like uh uh my sister died when i was uh about <bout> what twelve years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very kind of traumatic thing for me and it uh i felt like i grew up a lot that day so it's um also difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child i don't want to forget those things 'cause i think they're very integral to um how i cope with life and how i perceive uh um hardships and obstacles and uh having that image of knowing my father on it's very very humanizing 'cause it's so easy to kind of you idolize your parents and i still idolize my father but to know he's he's a guy like me and as i get older it's um easier identify with uh the man he is
yeah;<psh> so i'd be uh sixteen or six um uh i kind of like the notion uh that uh they're they always say you wouldn't worry as much what people thought about you if you realized how people how much people didn't think about you and that's really hard to tell a sixteen year old and i don't know what the point of telling a six year old but um but yeah i feel like especially when you're in high school until it gets i mean nowadays you <y> i mean we live in los angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and i still am very if i find out someone eh either is upset with me or doesn't like me it bothers me to a great deal or i hate letting people down so i would like to come to a healthier place where just knowing that sometimes you just can't really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so
right;uh i'm a very compassionate guy i um i'm there for my friends i'm pretty selfless in that respect i um have a good humor about things like even with <laughter> even with being depressed or depression i can joke about it it's not you know i'm not a morbid depressed more just the i'm aware of when i'm uh i'm low and uh i treat it as such and i don't you know i don't try to deny it i don't try to like any of that but i i i have a i'm a i'm a pretty like practical person in that respect i don't think uh even when i'm depressed i don't take it out on people or i don't think people people have told me they don't even seem to when i mention that <cough> been going through like depression no one seems to like or they don't mention i for one feel like when i do go through it it's like oh everyone can just tell and i'm just a smoking gun of sadness basically <laughter> but uh but no i i tend to carry it pretty well and uh um i don't i don't lose sight of uh the reality <rea> the reality of what i know is happening so
uh huh;mm
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um i was on a my uh my girlfriend came uh she was in thailand for three weeks and then she was supposed to go to spain for two but she canceled that trip and came back and stayed with me for about ten days and um
aw;yeah i know i <laughter> i love her she's great um she's the coolest person i know and so much fun and she uh when she's around she makes me so happy and uh um so having her for ten days and we just had like normal we we rarely get normal couples time like it's always like oh i see you for five days and then one of us has to go somewhere um so to have ten days just normal where we could just cook dinner at home like lie in bed and read books or anything like that was great and uh it makes me so happy that i have someone that i can do that with and just it feels so uh practical and feels so right
that's so good to hear;um <sigh> i guess for xxx i'm i'm i'm a good guy like i i i know i don't uh i don't think i screw people over i don't um i'm a good friend to have i'm i'm there for people i look out for people i care uh about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and i try to make sure you know with a lot of my friends being on the east coast i try to carve out time to make sure that they know i think about them and i call them and so i i feel like uh for a lot of people who count me as their friend i'm probably one of their better ones in just the sense that i'm i know how much i appreciate and respect uh the friendships we have
mhm;thanks ellie
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;pretty good
that's good;alexandria virginia
really;mhm
when did you move to l_a;uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one
that's a long time;yeah it's crazy <laughter>
how often do you go back to your hometown;um a couple times a year usually like for holidays
how does it compare to l_a;hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle>
mhm;i went to um grad school at u_s_c
cool;um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad
uh huh;film
how did you decide to do that;hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school
that's great;um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle>
what's your dream job;<sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle>
i understand;yeah
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;<laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount
what do you enjoy about traveling;um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything
awesome;<sniffle>
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle>
okay;um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath>
how did you feel in that moment;um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting
that sucks;yeah <laughter>
tell me about your relationship with your family;um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship
that's good;<deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle>
i see;<deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good
why;i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know
are they triggered by something;not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle>
what are you like when you don't sleep well;cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle>
i understand;um not really no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;<deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle>
what got you to seek help;um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle>
what were your symptoms;um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally
that sounds really hard; yeah
do you still go to therapy now;yes
do you feel like therapy is useful;yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;<deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter>
okay;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family
can you tell me about that;yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace
aw;<laughter>
that's so good to hear;<laughter>
how would your best friend describe you;um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter>
okay;<deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so
oh no;yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter>
yeah;<deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle>
that's great;<laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle>
mm;hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
that's good;i'm doing okay it's still morning so
where are you from originally;i'm from the east coast massachusetts
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter>
how often do you go back to your hometown;um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas
how does it compare to l_a;um l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street
uh huh;so the
i see what you mean;yeah
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses
that's good;um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy
nice;no not at all
why;um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately um overseas
okay;um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out <sniffle>
i'm sorry to hear that;oh that's alright
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;gah um i don't have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter>
mhm;so
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book
how are you at controlling your temper;um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself
yeah;so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so
okay;um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently
is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this;um it upsets <ups> it's upsets me so
i'm sorry;it's okay
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;um let me see <deep breath> uh <sigh> i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter>
okay;<sniffle>
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired
yeah;but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't uh i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep
are they triggered by something;um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it
that sounds really hard;uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so
uh huh;i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter> i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee
(laughter;yeah so other than that i'm i'm okay
how have you been feeling lately;um well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened
that's good;um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day
i see;yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis
how long ago were you diagnosed;oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine
what got you to seek help;um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so
is going to a therapist helping you;um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions
yeah;so
i understand;um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so
okay;um uh <sigh> i would say when my son was born years ago
do you find it easy to be a parent;i'm not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well
i'm sorry to hear that;uh
what would you say are some of your best qualities;hmm um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and um you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible
that's great;excuse me
is there anything you regret;oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done
right;um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion that's all
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot you know sleep eat sleep eat and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me
uh huh;um hmm trying to think it's been a long time actually there's really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now um so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;um my weekends saturday <sa> uh like on saturday i'm usually working um on sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house um run some errands go shopping for food you know that kinda thing so it's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know go out clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now
(laughter;xxx
what are you most proud of in your life;um hmm really there's nothing that i can think of um there's nothing that i can be proud of hmm
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood;um some a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that um sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like because i like make fun of him um but mm just that's it you know go <g> maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;no problem thank you
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah go ahead
okay;um i'm okay
that's good;i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california
wow;mhm
when did you move to l_a;i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that
how often do you go back to your hometown;um <sigh> at the most probably twice a year
how does it compare to l_a;<laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter>
(laughter;um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so
uh huh;so i gave it a shot and here i am
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so
yeah;<sigh> <laughter> i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um i was in morocco and i was in costa rica um i've spent some time in mexico so yeah
what do you enjoy about traveling;um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um sure well i guess hmm i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible
awesome;yeah
what did you study at school;um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies
are you still working in that;no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach
yeah;um to guess i'm not clear on the question um
let's come back to that later;okay
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;<laughter> wow um <sigh> you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and um really contributing to people
okay;um my relationship's pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and we've been we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so
that's good;um <mutters> well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah
mhm;i'm shy
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so
uh huh;yeah yeah
how are you at controlling your temper;um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so
can you tell me about that;yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didn't show up and uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated
yeah;oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and i'm in a coaching program and it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone who's not my coach and uh that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know so yeah i wasn't um i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i could've certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would've made the call go a lot smoother
uh huh;hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging
what made you decide to do that;oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move
that sounds like a great situation;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh> relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily
are they triggered by something;um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah
how hard is that;um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation
i see;um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy
i'm sorry;<laughter> thanks
have you been diagnosed with depression;i have in the past yeah
how long ago were you diagnosed;oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago
what got you to seek help;i was suicidal
do you feel down;oh yeah i feel down mhm
do you still go to therapy now;i don't actually no
why did you stop;um well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and um and then i began therapy again later on think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so
do you feel like therapy is useful;yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous
right;i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever
yeah;<deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow huh wow that's pretty sad um it was at least a year ago no i that's not true it was when i um saw my biological mother which was last may
what would you say are some of your best qualities;my best qualities um <sigh> i'm very strong very strong-willed i um am very supportive and loving and nurturing um i'm easy to be around i'm intelligent and um yeah
is there anything you regret;anything i regret i don't think so no
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<sigh> don't take life too seriously <laughter>
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;oh my ideal weekend um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends um either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to um a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together um maybe go dancing after um and sundays i usually go to scrubbed_entry and then i have brunch with friends and um yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so
okay;hmm <sigh> i am most proud of um a few things i mean i've moved to places that i wanted to move to and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually um mm achieve those those um goals or those yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california
that's great;mhm
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;sure
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;pretty good
that's good;i grew up in boston
really;about thirty years ago
that's a long time;yep
how often do you go back to your hometown;not too often maybe once a year sometimes less
how does it compare to l_a;oh i love living in l_a i don't ever wanna live anywhere else
why did you move to l_a;well i came out here to go to college and i wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it
okay;uh very easy well maybe somewhat easy the beginning the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody i knew but after a few weeks it was great
mhm;broadcast journalism
that sounds interesting;well it's something i'd wanted to do since i was twelve and everything i did from the time i was twelve until i went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream
are you still working in that;no <laughter>
why;well it's kind of a long story but i got laid off from my first job when i was in my twenties and it just once i had done that work i realized that's not really what i wanted to do it was too cut-throat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me it didn't make me happy
yeah;yep <sigh>
what's your dream job;my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries
nice;<deep breath> well the work itself is not very hard i'm very good at what i do the hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them
i see what you mean;it
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;i used to i don't travel so much right now
what do you enjoy about traveling;i love seeing different places and different things like i love going to places that are not like where i'm from
uh huh;my favorite trip is i went to australia for my thirtieth birthday
wow;'cause i wanted to lose my thirtieth birthday as i crossed the international date line
(laughter;and i went to this really small <sigh> place up on the uh west coast of australia called shark's bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and i got to be there for a whole week and just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world
awesome;more shy <sigh>
why;<deep breath> why <sigh> hmm that's a good question um partly the first thing i think of is 'cause i've always been that way but maybe that's an excuse i don't know um <deep breath> i just prefer to be quiet and i'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people so <sigh>
okay;<deep breath> i watch t_v <sigh> a lot or that's probably not the best alternative but it is something i do and i also walk on the beach 'cause i live close to the beach so that's one of my favorite things to relax
uh huh;<deep breath> pretty good it depends on the situation but most of the time i'm pretty good
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;<deep breath> um i don't think i tend to argue with people i think i just get mad about situations but not at people directly <sigh>
mm;<sigh> hmm <sigh> i don't know if i feel guilty about anything at the moment
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;not sure i have one at the moment
okay;<deep breath> noise other people's noise makes me really mad um i live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors that that just makes me really mad <sigh>
that sucks;yeah <sigh>
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;hmm <sigh> well the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is is when i bought my condo it felt like a really hard decision at the time you know i didn't know that i could do it i didn't wasn't sure if i had the money to do it um so that felt like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that
yeah;pretty easy i sleep pretty well <sigh>
that's good;<deep breath> for the most part good i'm i'm just really worried about money <sigh> at the moment so that's my biggest so i can't say that i'm like great but i it's 'cause i am worried but you know i'm also confident that things are gonna work out
that's good;nope <sigh>
have you been diagnosed with depression;nope
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;<sigh> hmm <sigh> i don't know i can't remember i mean i don't feel super happy all the time but i don't feel unhappy either sort of like just uh even keel
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;well i got to go to the um my friends work at the motion picture academy so i get to see all the xxx oscar-nominated movies scrubbed_entry she was there one night so uh i really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant <sigh>
nice;<deep breath> i think they would say um reliable and loyal <sigh> and considerate and thoughtful
is there anything you regret;<deep breath> no <sigh> i really have worked hard on that i think there are lots of things maybe i would do differently but there's nothing that really i regret
like what;um <deep breath> well i just think that there are things that um <sigh> like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that i regret so i don't have a lot of xxx regrets about things
okay;<deep breath> oh that's a good question <sigh> um <sigh> don't worry about the small stuff and save more money <laughter>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;like <deep breath> well there's uh you know the normal things like i'd lose more weight and i would um uh <sigh> think be a little more fearless maybe <sigh> be a little more bold
mhm;i don't think i have any the of those
okay;<deep breath> well i'm i am self-employed so i work all the time <laughter> so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients um that's something i enjoy um so that would that would be ideal at this point my weekends if i were really busy
what are you most proud of in your life;<deep breath> that i've really been able to take care of myself and that you know i've done pretty much everything that i've said that i've wanted to do i've done that and i don't and i don't have regrets about things there's nothing really that eh is un feels undone in my life sure there's plenty of things i still wanna do um but i feel like i've done what i said i was gonna do
that's great;<deep breath> yeah <sigh> that's not so great well it's okay um both my parents are deceased and i have a sister and a brother um i feel closer to my brother than my sister but um they both live on the east coast and i live in l_a um and then i have <ha> my sister has two girls so i feel very close to my nieces although we don't talk as much as we used to 'cause they're teenagers so they have other things on their mind
(laughter;<deep breath> um probably my teacher a person i learned my holistic body work from i really like to <sigh> model my work and my way of being after him like he's a a good role model for me the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life
that's so good to hear;<deep breath> um we're pretty close we're not you know best of friends but i do i know that i can call him any time i need him
what are some things that usually put you in a good mood;um <sigh> put me in a good mood <sigh> usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or um <sigh> yeah just spending time with my friends
uh huh;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;thanks <sigh>
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;<sniffle> <sniffle> yes
okay;i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good
that's good;i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so
cool;it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah <clears throat>
what are some things you really like about l_a;some things that that i really like i would have to say you know the beach um you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah <clears throat>
yeah;right yep
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth> um you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so
mhm;yep <clears throat>
what do you enjoy about traveling;um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so
yeah;<clears throat>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so <clears throat>
nice;yep
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so <clears throat>
mhm;yeah i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months <clears throat>
that's great;yep
how did you decide to do that;well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories
yeah;i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so
uh huh;yep
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;<laughter> my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so <clears throat>
okay;my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said i'm twenty three years old um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well <clears throat>
that's good;you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and
mhm;so <clears throat>
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so
mm;<clears throat>
how are you at controlling your temper;you know i've actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so miniscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances
uh huh;<clears throat> yeah
what's something you feel guilty about;something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice <clears throat>
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah <clears throat>
yeah;yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old
aw;so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i don't i don't  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah <clears throat>
okay;my best friend <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah
mhm;<clears throat
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat>
okay;lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat>
that sounds like a great situation;yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part
right;<clears throat>
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;i have not no
have you been diagnosed with depression;nope
do you feel down;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so <clears throat>
how did you feel in that moment;i felt great you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah
yeah;<clears throat>
is there anything you regret;yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way <clears throat>
yeah;<laughter> well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just be careful you know make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be um basically you know just always be nice be honest um just be caring toward others so <clears throat>
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so <clears throat> yeah
okay;my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends um either you know we hang out in the day you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so <clears throat>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;some things that i wish i could change um probably just you know be nicer like i said before um maybe not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life but i know there are times when i i kinda get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so
mhm;<clears throat>
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;um well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so <clears throat>
okay;my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined i'm very caring now more than i used to be very honest and you know i i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh <clears throat>
that's good;<clears throat> something that i did recently that i really enjoyed um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that so
awesome;makes me feel good yep <clears throat>
what was it about;um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah <clears throat>
what are you most proud of in your life;i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating high school about to graduate college hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job you know in the near future i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of <clears throat>
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;thank you
goodbye;<synch>

oh no;i can't see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything
what do you enjoy about traveling;i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing
uh huh;mhm
i see what you mean;uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie
(laughter;um let's see uh well um i it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal
yeah;hmm it's a tough question um one <on> um <makes clicking sound with mouth> i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that
yes;yeah come back to it
let's come back to that later;yeah that's what i just said
what did you study at school;film
how did you decide to do that;you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like
hmm;um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck
uh huh;and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so
(laughter;i'm not really sure uh yeah it's it's it's um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but uh i've always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general
are you still working in that;i am yes
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put <pu> put together and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but
mm;i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing
okay;well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them um my i guess um it's funny you should ask ellie um i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't when away like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean <mea> and my family in general
mhm;well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like um i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um
why;i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it
okay;um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking
yeah;pretty good
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;well i always like arguing um i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject
uh huh;um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question
yes;um
when was the last time that happened;what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate
uh huh;hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie
why;um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like
mm;in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained
yeah;and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is
right;and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else
hmm;um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor
yeah;in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort
i understand;yeah i'm glad you understand <deep breath>
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so
hmm;yeah
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;the hardest decision i've ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions
yeah;hmm um like choosing between two things that it's like i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um
mhm;and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york
i see;it was how hard was that or how hard is
yes;how hard was that um it was hard <laughter> um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating <is> 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etcetera
yeah;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;well recently it's been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i i don't know
mm;tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go um without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess
okay;more introverted
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;since like lately as in when
whatever comes to your mind;um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just you know you you know <sigh> you know <sigh>
that's good;no i just
have you been diagnosed with depression;nope
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like
wow;you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't
uh huh;it's too much else to do so
that makes sense;i would say that i'm very accepting <acce> like accepting of other people and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um and open <o> open <ope> like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um
okay;hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um <sigh> yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself i'd i would i don't know <laughter>
um;hmm really badly about myself um <sigh> i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like there's no yeah i don't know
that sounds really hard;yeah
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that there's um i have a tendency to like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums
mhm;would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i um i don't know i guess stay uh don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;that's it
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;sure
goodbye;goodbye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;okay
that's good;from santa monica
really;uh the people mostly
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;<sigh> well the people also <laughter>
i see what you mean;<laughter>
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;uh no not a lot
why;well i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to
okay;mm i was an english major
that sounds interesting;uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study
are you still doing that;no not anymore
i love my job you could almost say it's virtually made for me what's your dream job;oh i guess my dream job would be to manage a uh soccer club
how hard is that;oh it'd be pretty much impossible for me
why;um i don't have any experience <laughter> in that field
i understand;i'm very shy
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;i play music
what do you do when you are annoyed;<sigh> what do i do when i'm annoyed i don't know um what do i do when i'm annoyed i can't think of anything i don't know i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically
okay;uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often
that's good;mm when was the last time i argued with someone <sigh> i can't remember uh yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone
hmm;<sigh> well let's see when i was um a little kid i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving um yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could
yeah;well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then um you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturbed that way but at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it
yeah;mm it was <wa> it was
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;<laughter> <sigh> situation that <sniffle> <sigh> i don't know um well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular um maybe i think that when i was a kid i um well i think that when i was let's see well i have okay i have a good one um i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married so that's a big one for me
can you tell me about that;yeah well we <w> we were together for about four years and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit and um that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other but because my selfishness and because i just uh had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been
mm;<sigh> well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was <sigh> no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't i never feel like i can help anyone who i know who has a problem so
when was the last time that happened;oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know
mhm;well they're um it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very uh uh i don't know what the word is it's on the it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense so yeah it's it's i think a lot of families are that way but it it is it does bother me that mine is that way
yeah;oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;no not not really i would say they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and no i don't think i've i've changed much
how have you been feeling lately;mm pretty down but like i said in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again i've always been this way so it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way
yeah;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;a long oh a long time ago i was um about ten years old or around there about
what got you to seek help;uh i was just missing a lot of school i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh it went from there
do you still go to therapy now;no i haven't gone to therapy since i was a teenager
why did you stop;well i didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day i just decided i didn't wanna go anymore eh
how has seeing a therapist affected you;uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much
do you have disturbing thoughts;no i wouldn't say disturbing no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;mm well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew and uh i have a my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them
that's great;uh my ideal weekend would be um i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world different food um and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a historical significance
awesome;<laughter>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town um that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so
wow;yeah it was a really cool trip
what's one of your most memorable experiences;<sigh> <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable
whatever comes to your mind;uh a memorable experience probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now that we should've gotten married um that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because it's it's still with me and um eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any mm particular day or any particular moment you know
yeah;oh a lot um wish i could be healthier for one thing uh more energetic and um more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier
how would your best friend describe you;oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think i think he would say that i'm a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish um and probably he would say that i'm creative also
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<sigh> wow well my advice to to myself i don't understand the question <laughter>
is there anything you regret;yeah but we already talked about it
right;<sigh> nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of any accomplishment anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had
okay;<sigh> uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine <laughter> and i don't usually do that but yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago

oh;i was talking on facebook with somebody about it but i think it's good to uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh it's natural to you know not always agree on things so

could you say a little more about that;uh when i when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more even-tempered not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have uh
right;xxx have sources of income
yeah;uh i think i'm creative and i think i'm a good listener
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;hmm to be as disciplined and focused as possible because once you're out of your parents' homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and a lot eh uh your life will be a lot easier
mm;hmm let's see here i wish i was more disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better at that
how hard is that;it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;hmm um some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome constructive criticism 'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people have to say that might be negative
mhm;hmm uh probably optimistic and um outgoing optimistic and uh helpful
okay;my ideal weekend uh i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income and um you know good weather
when was the last time that happened;uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but um i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes
nice;uh i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined um i read a lot uh i do crosswords and i think i've i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want
that's so good to hear;hmm i'm not a big fan of high taxes um but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh i guess i take it in stride though
that's good;uh i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun
what was it about;it was a documentary
uh huh;a sport <s> a sports

okay;i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you <laughter> the the digitial you that i'm saying uh i don't know it's yeah it's funny
really;um <tisk> because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh  be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself
uh huh;yeah
i see what you mean;i i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um that's where i'm from
cool;um well  there's a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is  that public transportation is coming up uh  that the idea of  certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very  thought upon and i feel that los angeles' deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand <laughter> yeah
mhm;um well the the human mentality here is um is very very hectic very chaotic you know a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that we're on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's it's very hectic um atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing
mm;yeah
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;well i can't see your shoes <laughter> but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh <laughter> i do love to travel yeah
what do you enjoy about traveling;um from my travels it's not like well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do i it's it's just more like i i enjoy not being uh trapped in the city with all these uh made up ties and restraints i enjoy traveling because i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image you know man <ma> man made image that it is here so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is
that's great;thanks <laughter>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;would you <laughter> okay <laughter> um
mhm;well i um kind of recently last year went to los banos central california area and although it wasn't that far from l_a it was completely different energy um there was no phones  there was no wifi there's no t_v there was um there was sanity there was a relative sanity  in the sense that um people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and  outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling I was working at a hot spring resort and i just got to breath and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry
hmm;yeah
how hard is that;um not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't
what made you decide to do that;um i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh get out of here and kind of kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah
okay;um well currently i'm studying um currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to
wow;scrubbed_entry  um for music composition so i was just writing scores for  films animations dance productions theater productions stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy
that sounds interesting; very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because  tuition hikes up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year b_f_a is uh not not the deal not trying to  trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans
yeah;so yeah
that sucks;hey that's not a good word sucks <laughter>
what's your dream job;um dream job hm my dream job would be anything <exhale> that i can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression i've got some great ideas <laughter> yeah
that's good;um i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah   
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah
uh huh;hmm pretty good i guess i haven't yelled in a long time
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion  and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes things are not ready to be written yeah so yesterday
okay;hm guilty that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what's something you feel guilty about
why don't we talk about that later;<laughter> okay
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;mm i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just be like i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah
mm;hmm um maybe the time scrubbed_entry um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out you know not all nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;the hardest decision huh hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a yeah that could've been the hardest
yeah;um it's just uh i don't i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that
right;but um yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um but another reason why i decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was  also because um art institute you know um that's a that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician being taught by a musician
mhm;to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know
right;and it's just um yeah it's just not quite as artistic as i thought art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah
okay;hm if i if i um it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah
how do you cope with them;um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh like chamomile and cannabis and just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter>
okay;mm mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no
how have you been feeling lately;i've been feeling kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh it's stable yeah it's it's comfortable yeah
mhm;no no i haven't
have you been diagnosed with depression;not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter>
can you tell me about that;um yeah i mean i just think like the whole you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different waves different swells um so yeah i think i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats
okay;really happy um i i mean i feel really happy a lot uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking
that's great;yeah it is <laughter>
how would your best friend describe you;um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess
okay;well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen be be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby
okay;mm um well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me is um my ability to work with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together yeah
uh huh;mm that's a weird question like um like that's trying to make me single out the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you
yes;yeah thank you

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter>
uh oh;i was born in canada
really;and but i've lived in california most of my life so and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish
when did you move to l_a;the <laughter>
yeah;oh my gosh years and years ago
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time
why;well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so
yeah;uh huh
how does it compare to l_a;oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with so
i see what you mean;mhm
why did you move to l_a;why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and this became our home base and uh that's why
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;easy very easy so
that's good;uh huh
what did you study at school;uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter> and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so
what made you decide to do that;um i don't know can't really pinpoint why <laughter>
okay;so
are you still working in that;i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate i'm a leasing consultant part time
are you happy you did that;i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives
what's your dream job;oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter>
(laughter;but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals
yeah;so
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> <laughter> oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things <laughter> so
how are you at controlling your temper;i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so
mhm;mhm mm i can't really remember so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so
okay;i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;mm i can't think of anything right now
hmm;i really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider
that makes sense;mm yeah
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;an event hmm well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more
yeah;but you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with that so
there are always trade-offs in life aren't there;mhm yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives
mhm;so
tell me about your relationship with your family;well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so
that's good;mhm we have a small family
what do you think of today's kids;uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very well-behaved so can't say much else about that
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't
oh no;yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter> but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's i can't say anything to her about that
that sucks;so yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so
what are you like when you don't sleep well;tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep
uh huh;mhm
how have you been feeling lately;uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that
right;i um i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so
okay;no mm mm
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;hmm <laughter> can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so
okay;no i never regret anything
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um you know seems like <laughter> uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um wasted time with certain people um i don't know those are the things that come to mind
uh huh;maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things
okay;but mm
how would your best friend describe you;outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so
that's good;mhm
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so
yeah;that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah
i understand;mhm
how would your best friend describe you;i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter>
yes;but uh if you want i'll repeat it so
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so
mhm;hmm that's a hard question <laughter> the can't think i mean i'm can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter>
what are some things you like to do for fun;for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um that's kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so
what do you enjoy about traveling;traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place
yeah;mhm
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;okay well <laughter> i've um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international
mm;and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so
wow;uh
that sounds like a great situation;yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um so yeah that's mhm

can you tell me about that;well i'm i'm one of i'm one of three <sigh> three sons <clear throat> so i really didn't have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related and my grandma and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow <snort> that was it i fell madly in love with her
that's so good to hear;changed my life yeah well that's the way it happened
what's something you feel guilty about;uh <sigh> when my mother got sick i i wasn't <wa> i wasn't there for her the way i should've been and i don't feel good <goo>
could you have done anything to avoid it;oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end <snort> i was just in a real bad situation
yeah;but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i shold've been at least not in my mind
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;uh <sigh> uh my second marriage probably she uh she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife and uh i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children <sniff> so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant and our relationship changed and i basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorved
hmm;uh i i i don't know that i would've had children <chil> would've would've had children with her but i i wasn't very flexible in the process
how hard is that;what to be flexible
yeah;i don't know sometimes i am sometimes i'm not
okay;uh that'd been pulling my uh pulling my father out of off uh uh life support
what made you decide to do that;i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger that he would come back and haunt me and if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but  that's what we did
okay;something i could erase from my memory uh being locked up for a while i'd like to erase that from my memory <snort>
can you tell me about that;it's just it's an everyday hell where there's very little humanity and uh you even do some things that you're not proud of
i see;i've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that  if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep so it's it's difficult <diffi> it's uh <snort> unless i'm really tired then you know <sneeze>
what are you like when you don't sleep well;i'm pretty much still the same i don't change
how have you been feeling lately;so so i had friend <f> uh things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh runned over in a crosswalk and uh he's on he's on life support so i haven't been feeling too good about that
i'm sorry;it's it's affected me it wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so
yeah;and he's on uh life support at this point
wow;mm no not really only consistent thing about me is i'm very inconsistent
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;uh no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;but i've had moments where i felt i was i was depressed okay i was talking when you were talking so i didn't hear the question
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;uh uh yesterday had a conversation with my fourteen year-old granddaughter i'm happy i have moments of happiness every day 'cause i i either speak to or text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day even if we're upset with one another
that's great;oh i have a lot of regrets
can you give me an example of that;uh i should've went to law school that's that's kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort>
like what;uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team
uh huh;had some tryouts things like that but they didn't pan out and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer so i just did other things
mm;i don't think it'd make that much difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um about myself uh <hums> uh i could be uh if i don't like you i could be very uh very difficult if i don't like you i'd very much like to change that
has that gotten you in trouble;it has in the past yeah <snort>
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you and i'm not real big on letting <let> letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault
mhm;and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass and and uh but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort>
yeah;<sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody uh whether i agree with you or disagree with you uh uh i've taught myself to uh control anger that i that i have uh and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh casually
okay;<snort> uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a with an old dear friend and we got caught up and uh <sigh> we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner met his new wife uh had a good time
that's great;a lot of a lot of memories came back
what do you think of today's kids;mm <snort> uh well i like i like my my kids <ki> uh my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them i don't know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but
yeah;but that's me mainly 'cause i don't but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think they're good i think they're pretty good
what are you most proud of in your life;<snort> uh <sigh> raising my girls basically by myself with the help of my mother i think that's the uh most proud of
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;or okay nice chatting with you
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm pretty good
that's good;uh as far as my parents ethiopia
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;um the beaches the warm weather um the diverse environment
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh traffic <laughter>
yeah;well i'm currently in school i'm studying african studies
cool;uh i've always been interested in african studies actually i've always wanted to help people and i figured that i could help them by trying to learn about it and going back to africa and make an influence
that's great;kind of in between i have my shy moments but then when i'm around a group of people that i enjoy i'm pretty outgoing
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;um to relax i normally write or i go to the beach and just sit there play my guitar
mhm;pretty good i don't really get angry or anything like that i tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um i actually can't remember the last time i argued with someone
okay;mm all the people i've hurt in the past
can you tell me about that;uh i've like cheated on people hurt their feelings intentionally done things that i shouldn't have done that i regret now
mm;mm um well with my ex i could've ended it better so we could be on better terms now um i probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things i probably should've just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out
yeah;um hardest decision i've ever had to make was man i really don't know actually
okay;um having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer
tell me about that;um well he had a tumor that he had to get removed so it was just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really didn't want to be there 'cause he's a really live person and he'd rather be running around and stuff like that but just seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible
yeah;uh me and my family aren't very close we don't i mean they've always been there for me and i appreciate it but we've never had that close connection <collection> connection <con> connection um especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where i'm trying to come from having been grown up out in america so it's pretty different when it comes to those cultural <cu> racial i mean the cultural boundaries that we kinda step each over each other's feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does get kinda awkward but it's okay
okay;i think they are out of control i think that they're learning things that they shouldn't know at this age i think that they're doing things that they shouldn't be doing and i don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it i feel like they're being applauded by the media they're being applauded by celebrities that they follow and there's not enough being done about it and they're just getting lost
yeah;um depends on the night some nights it's pretty hard some nights i fall asleep like a baby
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um usually creative actually when i can't sleep i'll just stay up and i'll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up um stuff like that it's usually a good thing when i can't sleep it's nothing really bad 'cause i'm having bad thoughts or anything like that
okay;um lately between a mix of good and bad i have my happy moments when i'm energized and i'm live then some nights some days where i'm just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking not like my live self
why;i don't know it's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs but they kind of balance each other out
mhm;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um the last time i felt really happy was hm today
tell me more about that;uh just from the moment i woke up it was a beautiful sunny day i went to see some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers um wrote a good essay feel pretty accomplished and i feel like my day is just a good day
that's so good to hear;my best friend would describe me as odd <laughter> most people would describe me as odd
why;i say a lot of odd things i do odd things i'm interested in things that most people aren't

what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;i don't wish i could change anything about myself i just wish i could build myself into the person that i'm truly supposed to be
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;um this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things i've done that i shouldn't have done all at one time how i've hurt people how i've hurt her the ways i've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once i reflected on it all
yeah;uh my parents
can you tell me about that;i mean although we don't see eye to eye they always bring me to this realization that i need at the end of the day although i never listen to them or i don't choose to listen to them once it happens i learned from it and i'm like oh that's what my parents told me so i learned to trust them more and i learned to understand that they are wiser than me and they do know more than me
yeah;um not so much anymore um i travel around l_a try to find new sights to see but as far as i don't travel outside
what do you enjoy about traveling;um discovering new things um discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities um i discover i like i enjoy discovering new people new cultures new things that go against what's normal for us and for myself
when was the last time that happened;um a few days ago i just drove out to the middle of the desert and i just sat there and i just enjoyed all that the desert had to offer and it was just enjoyable
nice;um i felt free away from all this these cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time it felt good

i'm sorry to hear that;thanks
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;definitely more shy i've always been that way
why;uh <sigh> eh just the personality that i've grown into but learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it

how are you at controlling your temper;uh eh not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just don't get on something and i don't stop
hmm;sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;<laughter> yesterday i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking
why;uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid um even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed
uh huh;um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what um makes me grow and i try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day little by little
okay;um <sigh> can't think of anyone right now
what's something you feel guilty about;um <sigh> i'd i'd i'd say uh not supporting my friends as much with their career choices <sigh>
can you tell me about that;uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter>
okay;<deep breath> um <sigh> the raw food educators on youtube and <sigh> um raw vegan educators and the detox therapy <therap> therapy uh experts have been really inspirational in the past two months
tell me more about that;well uh they believe that um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and um the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on you know real research <laughter>
uh huh;really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science
that's good;uh i'm tired
how have you been feeling lately;been feeling better than i have in a long time
can you tell me about that;uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short life time of um you know toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be
mhm;<deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and more control over my uh decisions and my wants versus what i need that sort of thing
that's great;nope

do you still go to therapy now;no
why did you stop;uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor um you know taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that
mhm;yes
can you tell me about that;uh i believe therapy is useful because um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically um therapy um will help in overall health and mental health i believe for everybody
yeah;last night um i made a really great vegan uh dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter>
that's great;yeah
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;uh i would say uh you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx is an example
how hard is that;it's very very hard it's a daily process
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;um i was uh handling money for uh a business partner and they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula
yeah;um no
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day

can you tell me about that;um <sigh> lots of food uh great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people how to uh maybe better themselves especially food-wise and what they're eating
awesome;uh eating and um watching a really good t_v show

can you tell me about that;yeah um pretty much she um thought that because i wanted my rent which she agreed to pay that i was not being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and that wasn't going to happen
yeah;so you know the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend i could've kicked her out i didn't

can you tell me about that;um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn
that's great;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;uh it's been quite some time officially it's probably been i don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than fifteen years ago
what got you to seek help;um i was feeling suicidal
do you still go to therapy now;no
why did you stop;um because i found a better alternative
tell me more about that;um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and i've tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened
how did you decide to do that;well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me
how did you feel in that moment;i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh that um <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time
that's great;<laughter> um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again  and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue
awesome;it was awesome <laughter>
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;mm yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter>
okay;um well <laughter> there's probably a lot but um i'm always working on being more optimistic um it's been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better
mhm;<laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter
can you tell me about that;uh he's i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um i'm pretty lucky i think

mm;i'm pretty good at it i'm very calm um i worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid 'cause the money they're spending so i'm good at resolving <reso> resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job
that's good;i had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is l_a
yeah;<laughter>
what's something you feel guilty about;i really don't feel guilty about anything decisions i've made in my life i've think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head
mhm;i had a slum lord landlord and um i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code
yeah;i a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back  to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming to l_a and going back home i decided to move there and i had just started you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing
yeah;i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism
are you still working in that;um somewhat i'm doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of you know writing <wri> writing for someone else

mhm;i was a nerd no <laughter>
tell me about your relationship with your family;um my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and i have a good relationship with my mom um i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me i have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we just communicate on facebook  or like twitter
yeah;oh i go right to sleep when i get tired i just go to sleep
how have you been feeling lately;pretty good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more event work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than i was
how hard is that;i mean it's kinda hard 'cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else
mhm;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies i wouldn't say that i'm just
okay;super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even keel that i feel pretty good all the time
yeah;i'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and i could adapt to different situations and even if i it's not my scene or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt
uh huh;i wanna make more money <laughter>
(laughter;<laughter>
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;i remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me 'cause i was very tall and skinny and i had like straight a's one of the highest grades in the class so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that

that sounds like a great situation;i like the area mhm
what's something you feel guilty about;i guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time a day into it
i see what you mean;i don't really know anything like that i would wanna erase or not happen
okay;no i feel good about my choices i've made and i think i'm on the right path and a lot of things i wanted to do then balls rolling and i'm getting <g> you know getting things done i'm not as big as i wanna be but i feel like i'm on my way there

can you tell me about that;<laughter> um mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball i'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know in my life telling me you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really good like motivation for me
mhm;<laughter> you know being published i've been on t_v shows and just getting my own event thing going and i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly kinda where i wanna be but it's a great start and i worked to get to that point

has that gotten you in trouble;uh no um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh i think it's you know it's kind of not the way that i would like to have handled it
okay;guess the hardest decision was about to of how to proceed with moving forward eh on a job opportunity
uh huh;i had to decide whether if i would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family and whether the financial gain and uh knowledge of that experience would over outweigh the benefit
that sounds really hard;uh yes yes i am
that's good;well i it's a small family but um have a mother and a uh sister and a brother and uh two younger nieces older they're they're grown adults uh it's a it's a good relationship and uh things could be better um sometimes it's sort of difficult pain staking uh relationship at times
why;there's uh some days i'm i need time for myself and i would rather give the time to other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience uh and so that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional pain uh a little bit of spiritual uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing
yeah;wow there's so many things <laughter> what about you i don't know anything about you i would say uh well there's there's a few um but of recent i um well things are going pretty good i'm can't really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember

you were very young weren't you;yes uh sort of but uh yes

mhm;um hanging out with some friends uh on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat uh or on a skiff a really small boat and um trying to fish in

mhm;there's a maybe a like a museum or uh stare at some art or uh maybe something in the local community maybe street art and uh or perhaps something with music or uh something something of that nature

okay i think i have asked everything i need to;bye thank you
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;hello  yes
okay; okay not too bad
that's good;i'm from chicago south side
when did you move to l_a;um back in nineteen seventy eight when i was eighteen
that's a long time;yes <y>
how often do you go back to your hometown;lately not much maybe once every two or three years
mhm;um it's totally different you know horrible weather and uh yeah it's just a whole different atmosphere
why did you move to l_a;um let's see my mother had moved to africa i graduated from high school and i had a friend out here so i just thought well let me try l_a
okay;uh very easy actually yeah i loved it from the moment i got off the airplane yeah
what are some things you really like about l_a;number one the weather um sun is very important to me so i love the weather um i don't know just kind of a more laid back atmosphere variety of people
uh huh;and now it's my um my home base you know my friends that are family so it's kinda like my family is here now
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;hmm i guess the smog earthquakes um traffic just basic things like that really
yeah;um i don't currently but i did throughout my life i traveled quite a lot
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing um more history and meeting  people and just fun and the the fun of it as well
mhm;um let's see well one trip i went to england ireland and scotland and france all in you know one trip so that was a nice variety
nice;um i guess you could say probably skiing in val d'isere france that was fun i'm glad i got to do that
that's great;i'm kind of shy by nature i've tried to grow out of being shy so i'm not fully shy but i was always a an extremely shy child but now here in culver city this is my environment and i i guess you could say i'm not really shy in in my hometown of culver city
yeah;hm to relax i like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch t_v sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kinda vegetate
mhm;uh pretty good yeah my temper's pretty level
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;hm probably with my husband and i can't remember at the moment what it was about
okay;um well when you say my family do you mean my  family from childhood or my current family
whatever comes to your mind;okay well i guess my current family comes to mind i i have two daughters and my relationship's pretty good it's okay with them but they're teenagers which uh you know going they're going through a lot of hormones and um they can be kinda bitchy <laughter> and
(laughter;and um but i have hoped that you know they'll grow out of that and soon someday we'll have a really good relationship um and then there's the husband which i i guess i could say soon to be ex husband hopefully soon  <laughter> we need to get a divorce but we're still together due to financial reasons and yeah
okay;yeah so that that's not good the the relationship with the husband but um but since we have determined that we need to divorce our our we don't expect anything out out of each other so we don't argue as much so that's good
yeah;hm well i guess our marriage i wish i had noticed early on that you know it was like way off from what i thought it was
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;um <sigh> let's see oh my god hardest decision i guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard
can you tell me about that;um well you know we were married and i wasn't content i guess you could say um and i kinda just gave up on our relationship and i i now that i look back i think it's because i wanted children and he would've been happy to never have any and so uh since i didn't have a father it was very important that i create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so i was kind of at a age where i needed to start thinking about having children yet i was with someone who really was not into it so that i think that's one uh maybe the core reason why i was not content and i just felt like <tisk> this marriage isn't gonna work and so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not wanna break up and <tisk> um <tisk> and i had to leave him because i just wasn't happy and that was that was very  hard 'cause you know i felt like i was hurting him  which which i was you know and he survived he got over it now he's  married with two kids <laughter> <laughter> but um it was hard to leave him
yeah;mm something i wish i could erase from my memory i have to think about that i'm sure there's something <gasp> oh well yeah there's um i guess it'd be nice to erase from my memory  um a recent i mean not recent but an event in my recent adulthood here in culver city where one of my best friends um i've betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really needed  a larger home and um we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent both to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home <tisk> and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and uh yeah that was devastating i don't think i had ever  been betrayed like that so i wish i could  erase that now 'cause now you know this was back when the kids were really young and um my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let's say six maybe um maybe five anyway her <h> her and my best friend's daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and um they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school  so they didn't get to hang out during those years but every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even though it's her their moms weren't talking to each other anymore so now they're thirteen and fourteen and they're in middle school together and they're still very connected in fact <laughter> she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it's just a little awkward you know 'cause now these girls are becoming really good friends better friends um and yet i still have this vivid um bad memory of what her her mom did to to me
yeah;that was about what ten about eight years ago anyway <sigh> i tried to i tried to
i'm sorry;ignore it and put it out of my head and which i've been able to <sniff> in recent years but obviously it still comes up
yeah;anyway that that was that
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;<sniff> um not that easy i do sometimes get a decent night's sleep but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep and most of the time i wake up and can't get back to sleep uh or i finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing
are they triggered by something;well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom <laughter> and then um <tisk> you know it's not always that easy to get back to sleep and then i wake up again to go to the bathroom so i guess that's the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there i don't know i think there's just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day i feel like i haven't accomplished enough during the day so it's hard for me to just go to sleep when i'm supposed to i guess
okay;um well i'm kinda used to it now so i just go on through the day probably looking <laughter> looking tired and um i i'm kinda used to feeling tired i just do what i need to do and sometimes if i'm able to if i'm at home and don't have huge commitments yeah i might just like i said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch t_v watch whatever
mhm;lately how have i been feeling um kind of down on myself down on life
can you tell me about that;well i have this pending need <n> need for separation slash divorce um <tisk> i worry that i made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they're teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood <clears throat> and so i worry that you know i did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and  <clears throat> now it's too late um like i missed out on a thing <th> a lot of things uh and yeah i need a job i'm unemployed i don't know what i wanna do with my life i know i wanna do something i i i just wish you know i never did finish college unfortunately because i was traveling and stuff so i i regret that extremely and i need to get a job and be able to take care of myself 'cause i need to divorce and move on with my life so now i forget what the original question was but  <laughter> um that's the state part of the state of my life
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;mm <tisk> well the first time or or or recently
yes;the first time i guess was you know when i was in my early twenties i was just a little upset about <laughter> coincidentally that was another breakup i had to make back then i was um <tisk> in my early twenties and i needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting 'cause i you know it was hard because he didn't wanna break up and i felt like i was hurting him and i didn't understand this feeling i was really upset how i didn't that was my first time having depression so i didn't really recognize <r> recognize it as depression but i went somehow i had the knowledge or the i was able to take myself to a psychiatrist i remember i paid for her by the hour and she prescribed xanax to just help relax me and so i guess that helped me get through that and then i've had depression throughout the years just you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as i guess it's usually a relationship <laughter> you know um yeah so the most recent time i was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about two years ago
mm;no
why did you stop;um money i i don't have insurance otherwise yeah i'd be happy to go to therapy <laughter> anything that might help
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;ooh <laughter> boy last time i felt really happy um i don't know i guess maybe when my children were born that's
how did you feel in that moment;<laughter> um i guess happy i don't know <laughter> i just you know i always wanted children so it was nice to have them that's i don't know that's all i can remember of that i don't i guess i don't remember the good times too well <laughter> i remember the bad times
yeah;<sniff> mm something i did that i really enjoyed well let's see i um friday night i went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun
that sounds like a great situation;yeah we get to
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;ooh <sigh> stay in college get my degree um get therapy try to become a happy um yeah try to figure out things earlier in life like yeah stay in college and oh and mainly i think the main you know what it all boils down to <laughter> no matter what you're depressed about it seems like as as the saying goes and the songs <s> the songs go you know it's all about money the world revolves around money and having none that in itself is very depressing <laughter> so besides relationships and different things  that have happened in your life having no money is you know it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it so with that in mind i would uh definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to stick <s> get a job and stick with it um don't quit to go traveling you know just stick with a job stick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field yeah that would've been my biggest piece of advice to myself
okay;not much <laughter> i guess just my daughters you know they're beautiful daughters and i'm proud and glad that i was able to have children some people aren't even able to do that you know and they  try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that's the one thing i mean i wanted five children and i always wanted a boy which i never had but um i'm i guess that's the biggest thing i can think of to be proud of is having my two daughters
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i'm a very loyal friend and person that's why when that friend betrayed me it was so devastating yeah very loyal um very <inhale> happy <hap> i mean huh what was i gonna say i was gonna say happy lucky <l> go lucky i don't know where that came from i'm very i meant to say friendly and caring and um yeah i care about people and i'm interested in people and i care about animals as well actually that's another thing i'm proud of proud of being a vegetarian yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian i'm a vegetarian because i really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals too and you know i don't think that animals should be  tortured and live a a tortuous life just so we can eat 'em
yeah;so um what was the question do you remember the question
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay

what did you study at school;well i still study i'm studying psychology
that sounds interesting;mhm
how did you decide to do that;hmm well <sigh> i decided to go back to school um just pretty quickly so i went to junior college and then when it got close to graduate i knew i wanna transfer so i'd taken a a couple psychology courses and i decided i liked it so i just decided to make that my major and it i thought it didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math <laughter> so
yeah;<deep breath> mm <sigh> well now that i'm almost done i don't know if i'm gonna continue in that area
i understand;well what i wanted initially was to um <sigh> get into sports psychology but i'm not quite sure that's what i want either
okay;well i could be shy initially but um once you get to know me i'm outgoing
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> <sigh> i think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix
like what;well just a good movie i like foreign movies a lot um so a lotta right now i'm into um martial arts movie with subtitles so
cool;i think i'm pretty good
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;hmm you know i know they're not really long arguments i don't know if they're real arguments i know i argued with my boyfriend um <laughter> 'cause he hung up in my face but i don't know why and it got solved pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important
okay;wait i walked out without say oh okay
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;hmm i can't think of one right now
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;<sigh> i think the hardest decision i probably had to make was moving from well back to california from oregon
can you tell me about that;well i was really young so i was um nineteen twenty-ish and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard 'cause obviously i had to support myself
what made you decide to do that;because it was really really boring in oregon so um i really like the activity here in l_a
i see what you mean;you know i don't really feel guilty about many things
okay;well i don't talk to them that much um my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talk to 'em on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when they come out here i wanna say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often then i see them um that's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah
mhm;hmm well i've had lots of positive influences i think um just regular people i come across you know maybe someone i've worked with maybe um like oh actually my uncle he's a really good positive influence he um he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice
like what;mm about <bout> life
okay;hmm you know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happen to me where i just don't uh where it bothers me so much i have to not think about it
okay;pretty <pret> well i can't say pretty easy 'cause i work odd schedule and then i go to school but um yeah if i wanna go to sleep i sleep really well though as long as i have enough you know hours
that's good;really really happy and good
that's so good to hear;<laughter>
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;nope
have you been diagnosed with depression;no

awesome;<deep breath> hmm <sigh> oh i haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that i had a lot of fun doing was ice skating um in december downtown <dow> in downtown l_a
wow;no i don't really have too many regrets i mean whatever happens happens and you know it was meant to play out that way
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;hmm well um i guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things um even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and uh you won't think about it six months from now
okay;i think my best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me and i'm just a cool person
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;hmm well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more i wish that uh <sigh> i would exercise more and i wish that uh that's yeah i think that's it right there
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;hmm <sigh> i don't think i wanna talk about that
okay;hmm i don't know i guess uh just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home i guess that's about the best accomplishment there is
that's great;thank you
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;<clears throat> i'm actually feel <f> i feel pretty good 'cause i uh i slept all day yesterday almost and i usually i'm doing something if it's not work it's school if it's not school it's work and then social life and all that so um i actually didn't have work yesterday and i don't have school i only have school on the weekdays so i actually slept probably like eighty five percent of the day so i actually feel kinda good but i'm actually kinda tired as well and i have other stuff going on but other than that i'm good today
okay;i'm originally from bakersfield california
really;really
when did you move to l_a;uh i moved to l_a when i was an infant and then i left here when i was around three or four and i've been move i moved back here in oh seven and i've been living here um ever since
how often do you go back to your hometown;um wow since i've been here since oh seven i've only been back maybe <clears thoat> maybe like a couple times <ti> well i went there for like a summer like in oh eight i think i was there for like almost the whole summer but i've only been back a couple times um since i've been back here unfortunately
how does it compare to l_a;uh <sigh> uh <laughter> uh it compares to l_a um it doesn't really compare to l_a i i grew up in sacramento actually i didn't get to tell you i was born in bakersfield then i lived here and then i anyways i don't know if i did i forgot anyways um yeah there's like nothing really to do there it's really small it's the valley um l_a has all the stuff to do it has um oceans and it's by all kinds of um located um by a lot of um cool places like vegas and uh san diego and what have you not so <s> um but yeah other than that i miss my friends and stuff but i don't miss like the actual city i just miss uh some of the people that i grew up with
yeah;oh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot actually i've only been out of california like six times so i would like to travel once i uh have enough money to do so
okay;um well originally i wanted to be a filmmaker and which i still wanna be a filmmaker and i um studying <stu> i was took i took communications and uh did general ed stuff too and um took like video production classes and um <tisk> <lip smacking> did a lot of stuff uh in regards to um filmmaking and i have learned a lot of stuff and i still have that knowledge however i haven't really used it since i've been back here in l_a i did all that stuff in northern california in sacramento but um and then i transferred <trans> um switched over to be uh to business which i took some classes in that but now i'm actually studying to be an optician and i'm actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get in the field and become an optician so
wow;but i do wanna be uh i actually still wanna be a filmmaker and um that's still one of my plans and i still actually i got into um playing poker a few years ago and i really like the idea of becoming a full time filmmaker or full time poker player however both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of and you have to be like the small percent so we'll see if not then hopefully my optician career can take me somewhere
what made you decide to do that;to be an optician
yes;oh um uh i guess i was just trying to find something that it was like it's like a trade it's well it's a private college but it just like specifically trains you into um one field and you just learn that you don't do like your g_e and all these other classes like you normally would do for like um like a um a major or whatever you're gonna do so it just trains you specifically to be an optician and jump in the field i um took it just because i actually want <w> want to be a dental assistant and since <si> it sound like something maybe i could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually um got my attention to be an optician so i'm now trying to be an optician
that makes sense;and it's interesting so it's fun it's um really hard but it's interesting and it and it um and it's it's fun it has um rewarding um rewarding benefits as far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel more comfortable with
that's great;cool
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;uh i'm definitely outgoing however i can be shy sometimes like i'm kinda shy right now because talking to you and you're uh in a computer and you're a cartoon
(laughter;or uh animated or whatever <laughter> so cool but no usually ninety eight percent
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> um i actually which it is actually kinda funny and i think maybe this might go for some of the poker players too um i don't really i've never really talked to any professional poker player but as far as like um i actually playing poker is um actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like um stuff in the past or present um or future stuff that's coming up uh as far as like i am really relaxed <rela> i really um could just not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it's kinda like a therapy thing for me 'cause i don't like i guess you could say it's a kinda drug because um i don't think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed or stuff that's happened in the past i just like focus on poker so it's actually kinda relieving however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so i guess it's kind of like um catch twenty two or whatever but uh
hmm;yeah so no poker i play like to play basketball i like to watch movies i like to go to the beach actually one of the things i like to do is go to the beach 'cause it does um it makes me feel good but it i didn't go i usually only go to the beach when it's hot not during the cold season so it's coming up soon so i'm looking forward to that i'm gonna be busy but uh i'll try to go out to the beach as much as i can <laughter>
okay;um i'm really good at controlling my temper actually i've only been in like i'm thirty years old i've been in like six fights maybe and all six of 'em were started by the other person so i've never started a real fight in my whole life like i started fights when i was a little kid but talking about like real stuff like once you get passed it at like thirteen fourteen <sniffle> uh but yeah no i'm good like every now and then like there's been a couple times maybe in the past where like i wasn't able to control it but um as far as like ever being violent or anything that's never occured and never would but for um majority of the time yeah i don't have like people do stupid things all the time and i just like let it go especially like um on the freeway and stuff but uh
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh well i mean i argued a bit with my ex girlfriend a lot but uh it was just about really um petty things i guess that maybe we just i think we were good for each other but uh maybe some other lifetime because uh we just bumped heads too much so obviously she's my ex girlfriend probably for a reason so
mm;we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend things
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;uh um i guess my filmmaking <filmm> um handled differently there's a lot of stuff i could've handled differently but uh uh maybe like when i was doing really good when i was younger and i was um working for scrubbed_entry production assistant for filmmakers around um where i lived in sacramento so i was doing everything that i wanted to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot all my stuff together i had my own car my own apartment and then i got involved with like uh the wrong group of people i guess and kinda tumbled downhill from there and like lost everything like car job apartment so i just wish that maybe i never got involved with those kind of people that kinda of girl um uh ever uh because <clears throat> i woulda probably it probably my life probably would be a lot different now however i believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously i think you should also like if stuff happens good or bad uh <sigh> uh learn from your other mistakes so that when it happens again you could um not make that mistake or try not to make it as bad i guess so
yeah;you know
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;mm hardest decision i guess i guess uh hardest decision the hardest decision i have ever had to make would be um i guess you could say uh i don't really know was gonna say that uh maybe like my ex girlfriend like i could've like stayed with her and i really like still am in love with her and uh would like to be with her and miss her but i guess the biggest mistake <mis> um decision that i had to make was like i know that it wasn't like a healthy relationship and i know if we like stayed together or if we got married or had kids that i don't think it would end up working out anyways so i guess the decision my hardest decision would be to like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and uh be uh not with her so i guess that was a hard really hard decision because um i could easily have done it and i guess maybe i would've been happier in that way but stressed out and um irritable or whatever and the other way of having to deal with her i guess deal with each other our our relationship so it was really hard still is so uh i guess that's it not choosing to be with someone that i i loved and loved me or whatever so
mm;cool
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;oh what was that i beg your pardon
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;nevad i don't understand the first part of that question
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;oh an event oh an event okay um that i could erase <sigh> uh event that i could from my memory uh my ex girlfriend i wish i'd never met her my first girlfriend and my last girlfriend i wish i never met them 'cause uh we <w> we were together in love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so i guess both of them
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;oh it's extremely easy i could fall asleep anywhere i actually the other day i broke a record i almost fell asleep standing up which would've been weird because i guess i would've
wow;fallen down or something i don't know i just caught myself
(laughter;i guess i was really <r> i mean i was really tired but i i do a lot of stuff so it's hard for i don't really get that much sleep
yeah;as much as i would like <l> like but i could sleep when i'm dead or whatever so as they say
okay;<tisk> uh no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
how have you been feeling lately;uh lately i'm just tired but i'm alright i guess i'm dealing with this breakup still it's only been like a month an a week but it's actually it's not i mean i've had worse things happen i mean worse things happen had worse things happen so yeah i guess
how do you cope with them;<sigh> well i'm a religious person i'm catholic i believe in god i know there's a god so um i obviously even all of it even devoted people to god um regardless of what they are they uh sometimes lose faith so i do lose faith sometimes but it doesn't really last for that long and i know that there is a god i know that i'll be okay and that everything will be okay but you know it's hard um deal with them i i don't really i just keep going you know go to school and work and i just have to keep going i can't give up so i just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of and like sleeping a lot helps but i don't get to sleep a lot so um i don't know uh playing poker playing basketball
uh huh;deals helps me deal with it and like uh hanging out with my friends helps me sometimes
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;why uh uh uh i felt really happy on friday because um i went to san diego for the first time and uh i didn't it wasn't as cool as i thought it was gonna be but uh we were like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so i would've much rather been free during that time but i wasn't but we had fun and it was cool uh i enjoyed it so yeah i really liked uh i was had fun and i was happy about going to san diego for the first time and i um had a good time
that's great;oh she's <sigh> um <laughter> a lot of things but i guess i would say like be nicer to like um family members you know a couple family members that i wish i would've been different to um acted different to not that i was like a horrible but i could've been nicer in some instances that if i didn't know the situation at hand uh i would've never like really um went out and partied all the time like i did like high school and different part times of out of high school i would've just really focused on um schooling and stuff and then did the partying later uh wouldn't have gotten relationships that um so i would've just told myself more basically to be more uh have more direction be more focused i guess uh stay away from people and unhealthy relationships unhealthy people i guess not that i'm the healthiest but <sniffle> um yeah i just would've done a lot of stuff different but i um i don't know if i said this earlier but i believe everything happens for a reason um so i guess everything's happening now for a reason so i'm just gonna keep going
how would your best friend describe you;<laughter> uh <tisk> i guess they would the few that i do have or few that i used to have 'cause i have best friends now a couple i guess one new one and i've lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like went out own ways but i guess they would all probably describe me more as like um happy <ha> energetic uh funny crazy uh loud uh silly uh smart and uh i just in i guess in uh in general just like entertaining to be around have i haven't always <a> always been the best bestest best friend but i try you know my hardest
uh huh;so that's it like
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;cool um <sigh> change myself uh <tisk> i wish i was um <xxx> i wish i was like fifteen pounds lighter um i wish i didn't need uh how do i say put this uh i feel like um i feel like i'm a i feel like i i need to be like in a relationship with a girl i feel like i wish i didn't have to be like feel like that i needed to have a girl all the time and so i could that could help me like focus more and i wish that like i didn't need sexual um i wasn't always thinking about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as i do 'cause i feel like if i didn't concentrate or have to do like get be with girls or in a relationship to like well who i don't know how to say it but i'm just saying like i there's like guy friends that i know that don't need sex as much as i do and i feel like i need it more than i feel like sometimes that i wish i didn't need <n> need it as much so maybe i guess i'm addicted to it a little bit where like i i could focus on more things other than just i mean i don't just focus on sex but i just feel like if focus on if i didn't want it need it or think i need it as much that i could get more stuff done in my life
mm;but yeah so i'm trying i'm working on that
what are you most proud of in your life;<deep breath> <sigh> what am i most proud of uh i'm most proud of <makes sounds with mouth> the the i'm most proud <prou> oh i guess i guess i'm most proud of working for um television station back in sacramento and working on a lot of um film sets 'cause like i i was sixteen and i decided i wanted to be a fimmaker and then two years later a year and a half later basically i got i started making steps to become a filmmaker and then i ended up working <wor> working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really um really um good um cinematographer a really good um freelance cinematographer that was based that lives in sacramento they did a lot of things so i'm proud that had a dream and i went for it and i and actually ended up doing stuff to go towards my dream that were in my dream so um yeah i guess that's one of my biggest accomplishments which was like over ten years ago but i you know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or you know so

when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;i typically do not argue uh and i don't remember any instance of arguing with someone recently

that's great;thank you
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;okay mm okay sure
okay;mm doing okay
that's good;i'm from uh l_a
really;yeah
what are some things you really like about l_a;i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment
mhm;yeah
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag and um i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall it's okay
okay;uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter>
yeah;that's why that's my that was my major yeah
what made you decide to do that;um i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um the problem
mhm;mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time
why;um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di> uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to
what's your dream job;wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i don't wanna too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job
yeah;yeah <laughter>
i see what you mean;yeah
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of <laughter> open up too much so i have to like back off you know
(laughter;but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor
okay;oh really <laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> oh um well i listen to music um i'll um well i watch t_v um i'll um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too i'll be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances
mm;um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going
that's good;yeah
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;wow that's a good question um i'm not sure to be honest um i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that it's not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head
okay;well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret
i see;wow hmm that's a tough one i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter>
okay;okay
tell me about your relationship with your family;oh well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay but um uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in
okay;um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a long story short <laughter> um it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult
how have you been feeling lately;uh <sigh> well i've been feeling okay i mean um i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late
that's good;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h
mhm;the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression
why;well you know um like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh i'm doing okay but i you know i kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to
okay;wow that's a good one <laughter> really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth> okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago
that sounds like a great situation;yeah yeah it was
how would your best friend describe you;best friend i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter>
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part
mhm;um what do i regret well can you elaborate that <laughter>
whatever comes to your mind;uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all
mm;well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example i'd make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been well off for the rest of my life <laughter>
yeah;but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret
right;yeah
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;wow that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter> <laughter> well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know i'd like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends
mhm;uh that's interesting most proud of um i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad bad uh vice um you know i i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably i don't know if it's really proud um but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;my pleasure
goodbye;bye now          
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;uh i'm fine today today is my daughter's birthday
aw;california
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;um the beach
mhm;i love the waters
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;the gang violence violence
okay;um i lost a lot of friends growing up in um through elementary and high school just losing them through gang violence
i'm sorry to hear that;yeah thank you it was pretty tough out there <laughter>
yeah;um haven't been to any place out of california yet so not really
okay;um i'm an optician i'm a certified optician and i also have my associate's degree
that sounds interesting;um actually i went in i didn't really know what i wanted to do when i first applied i just knew i wanted to change my life and do something successful um before i settled down and you know had my daughter and everything um actually my guidance counselor kind of helped me and i i always thought like they were so cool 'cause their white long lab coats
what's your dream job;to be a optometrist
why;um 'cause i'm already an optician and that's like the first step and um what i why is a good question it's because then i would have a be able to have my own business and i would have something successful to leave to my daughter and she wouldn't have to really want to anything it would be like a a family business but a a to help the community as well and something i could leave for my daughter
that makes sense;uh my daughter she's five years old uh she'll be starting elementary school next week and today is her birthday uh five years ago i had her <laughter> um she is very smart um i taught her home i home schooled her for five years and um she's adorable she's my heart
do you find it easy to be a parent;no this is like the hardest job ever <laughter>
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;it's very hard providing providing uh making sure that you wash their clothes um 'cause 'cause i mean it's hard enough to be um a parent but i'm a young parent and i'm a little more mature than her father so it's um it's it's the providing part i would basically say making sure that you have everything that they need it's so complicated let alone um it gives you enthusiasm to be more to go the extra mile um even being here today i probably would've still been in bed but today is my daughter's party and i was trying to make whatever extra little money i could make you know to make sure that she has a good day so it's all about uh going the extra mile doing anything that you can do to provide <pro> to provide for them but it it's a very hard job
yeah;um that moment of the day when your child tells you how much they care about you and um my daughter her favorite thing is to tell me i'm her i'm her heart you know and and how many i mean just call your name it just it's a sense of reality um to be called mom or to call call dad and it it just like it infatuates you it also let you know like this is reality this is this is my life this is what i'm living right now and it's a it's a very good feeling that's the best part of being a parent
that's so good to hear;thank you
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;um a lot of different things i'm actually taking care of my daughter <laughter> um i'm here with her uh i was raised by my grandparents so i mean i didn't really i didn't get to know my mom til i was sixteen and my father i mean i couldn't point him out on the street on the sidewalk so i don't know who he is so i feel that um i'm very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting i don't give up
yeah;yeah
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;um i guess i there's been <yawning> oh excuse me um there's been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life i can say um my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she's in the uh she's an l_v_a and um she's one of my older sisters um i can say me believing in god being in my life god being in my life has also kept my strong and to know that i don't have to take on this world by myself because god is there for me and um hm i don't know i don't really look up to a lot of different people because people lie so and that's the most what i could think that's been positive for me
okay;i think i'm outgoing <laughter> i used to be shy um coming up as a kid and i don't know i don't know what happened to me uh one day i just broke out of my shell and i've been um very accurate of showing my personality off <laughter>
(laughter;um i actually like for the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and i like to just sit there and just zone out everybody else that's there and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing
mm;um <yawning> excuse me sorry about that um i learned not to uh 'cause it's a form of it's a form of knowing who's in control and is it your life or someone else's and i feel that my temper me controlling my temper is showing that i'm in charge of my life so i don't even let stuff get to me i don't even really remember the last time that i had to control my temper because that's how much i try to block out the  the negativity
that's good;mm probably my husband <yawning> my daughter's father um uh probably over like uh you know the dishes or like the small things but not uh physical altercation like with another human being no
okay;wow um being honest i kind of feel guilty about how things like uh basically how things ended um before my mom passed i wish that i could've helped her a little more even though people tell me not to feel bad um because she wasn't really there for me growing up but i kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as i could've been for her before she passed away so i think that's something that i um i still feel guilty for
okay;um going through my mom passing away
how did you feel in that moment;um i felt like <clearing throat> i felt like um basically that it was i felt kind of robbed in a sense like i felt everyone else had parents and i grew up with my grandparents and then for me to go so many years without actual you know mom and dad for me to get eighteen years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like um i don't know it was nerve wracking because i felt robbed you know it was like i didn't have her all these years and then now that i'm older and i'm i don't even have her now so
yeah;um signing the paper of having a c section when it was time for me to have my daughter i was so nervous so scared um really didn't know what to do how to take it and i mean like that was so scary
what made you decide to do that;um it was the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world
are you happy you did that;yes
that's good;it's hard <laughter> i didn't even sleep last night that's why i'm yawning <yarning> but um uh i i kind of tend to try to do everything and i have to get back to that stage where i have to think about myself as well and give myself time
mhm;um a little like this but actually i'm a little nicer today <laughter> um just groggy
okay;um <yawning> lately i've been feeling very confident about um being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent
that's great;uh <yawning> yeah i actually really don't care what other people think anymore i used to let that bother me but i don't no more
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um uh today 'cause i was so happy that i brought <brung> my daughter into this world today on her birthday
uh huh;um getting to know people
is there anything you regret;mhm mm not at the moment
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;if i go uh to watch who i associate with
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;my weight <laughter>
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;uh i would say my grandma
can you tell me about that;mm um uh uh it's it's just uh i'd rather not
okay;um my daughter that's my pride and joy
that's great;wow thank you
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;sure
okay;pretty good
that's good;new york
really;uh i moved to l_a in the seventies
that's a long time;but i yeah but i lived a lot of different places
how often do you go back to your hometown;of um i guess every few years but i travel a lot so i've lived in i've lived in africa i've lived in spain switzerland hong kong too
wow;um different cultures food music rituals uh everything the smells the colors makes you feel alive
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;excuse me
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;one of my trips
mhm;uh i lived in kenya for about a year um i'd say i love horseback riding so when you're uh viewing other animals when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse you can approach the animals a lot closer so um it was great seeing red orange fall sunsets and riding along you know uh seeing so many animals yeah
what's one of your most memorable experiences;in kenya um probably when i went to a a masai village and i happened to i used to live in hawaii and i've had been to tahiti and i was wearing one of those pareos that are hand painted and i had it tied over the left shoulder with the twisted in a knot and i happened to enter a masai village for the first time uh that day and i looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist <laughter> on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed masai
(laughter;and uh <laughter> and um then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings so they would've like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then they gave me some bracelets and then they had uh me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper masai <laughter> so but i i yeah i just i have a lot of uh i think living
aw;getting a chance to live in different countries around the world i've just uh you feel alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken yeah
that's great;<sigh> i think it's not so clear cut i think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both i mean i think i can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times probably one of my best virtues is i'm very gutsy person so when i really feel passionate about something i risk everything to go achieve it sometimes um i believe that um usually i well i make decisions very quickly and i find that i have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how i can make decisions quicker and i told him i said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and i said not really because it's gut wise is only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice what you really wanna do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a ninety eight percent chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so i always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice 'cause who cares if you remain unscathed but it when it yields no joy
yeah;uh pardon you said you put your fish
what do you do when you are annoyed;what do i do when i'm annoyed
yes;um <sigh> <tisk> i think when i'm annoyed sometimes i it's because sometimes i can have i can need to be a little more patient um i guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy
how hard is that;um not really i think that's the reason why i enjoy traveling so much 'cause you're put in other situations where you're forced to to um understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are uh from yours different situations i've been to so many third world countries and and lived in so many different situations that you <y> it it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is
yeah;<sigh> let me think um <tisk> uh <sigh> last time i argued about something um god i'm trying to remember <laughter> um oh i think it was when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something
can you tell me about that;um uh <sigh> oh i know what it was um it was somebody who belonged to the uh uh scientology faith um i uh inherited i inherited um possibly uh a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and um uh i sometimes even right now i have like skin rashes welts and everything and i am very photo sensitive and um <tisk> i had an you know an episode where i was i had big flare up and i wasn't really feeling well i felt flushed and everything and the scientologist tells me that i needed to be audited and um and he said something about are you aware of past lives and i had told him that i was buddhist and i was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed and to be able to talk to them
yeah;and i and he said that are you aware that um <tisk> about something in your past and i go yes i believe that many religions uh including buddhisms and scientology believe that things that you have <ha> have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness um resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and also <a> we also believe i said that you know that you have the power of each person has a god like or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when i'm on the verge of possibly being i probably get one cold maybe every fifteen years i don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is i think when i think i'm on the verge i take sort of like and i did this even when i was a child uh when i was seven i would fold down i had my boo boo and i would take <ta> i would say i would have the good part you know help the bad part <laughter> from a simplistic way in terms of a child
right;and i would actually even when i was in a very severe car accident where i got cut by glass my whole back i concentrated healing and and when i went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that just <jj> her last week her back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so i believe that but uh um uh but i was just i think annoyed and irritated a little because the scientologist told me that because he had taken twenty or forty courses and he these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it didn't <did> it wasn't even a matter i said of whether he was um whether he took twenty forty courses or whether i'd been practicing buddhism whether it was for five ten fifteen twenty years or whether somebody'd been practicing some type of christianity for fifty years and bending sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean this person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has
yeah;you know so i just was thinking that was the antithesis of somebody who says they're enlightened but it's just the way i guess he kept cramming his uh you know his faith down my throat that after a while i was pretty patient with him but he it was so pompous that i became irritated
yeah;especially when he kept telling me that it was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery
i understand;uh the following week and i didn't point it out to him 'cause i just didn't wanna get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip 'cause you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn't need to get a hip surgery i mean i believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he's flippantly said well are you aware of scientologists believe that past lives can also affect you know and i'm thinking to myself buddhists of all religions are are kind of like well known for you know believing in in a cause and effect and past lives situations and i found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people <laughter> from other religions so but um <tisk> you know i i you know i i just didn't you know care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it <laughter>
yeah;but other than that i mean i don't
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;<sigh> um uh <sigh> sometimes to have a little more tact i guess when when it's in terms of patience
mm;i can think of that right away i guess uh disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital
i'm sorry;mm <sigh> mm my brother uh was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and i said well you know he's the medical one so he's probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept you know um um you know bucking the his body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard mm but you know it was after a while the uh you know even the physicians and even the uh pastor from that particular uh hospital <ho> you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he his brain function would've been <b> been you know negligible
yeah;yeah it was mhm
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;hm mm i don't think i really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that i've had to block them i really don't know what it is within my makeup which doesn't make me feel like i need to like i don't keep i have friends that have unmitigated issues which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear and for some reason i i feel blessed that i don't really i can't really even think of something that i mean i've had some bad situations happen to me but it's not that the some reason they've traumatized me in affecting you know my behavior where i would where i block it that i'm not aware of something or i hold residual negativity for some reason so i really can't think of anything i mean there's bad things that happen and i know they're there but it's not like i feel like i it's necessary for me to block them 'cause i've been able to you know um accept sometimes <so> sometimes there were unfortunate things that happened
okay;pretty easy i can usually make my sleep i self sleep in any situation if i have a one hour flight to san francisco i could just kind of lean against the window with the pillow have the blanket over and even on an hour flight pass out before the plane has even taken off from the ground so i can just <j> i have literally when i've had little sleep and i very uh high energy so i don't really need that much sleep but say like if i'm in africa and i <tisk> bumpy potholed unpaved road and i suddenly saw that i need a few moments of sleep i'll just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say i think i'll gonna take a nap for <laughter> fifteen minutes go like this and through the jostling i coud just take a nap for fifteen minutes so i don't really have <ha> have that problem
(laughter;okay pretty okay i mean i could deal without the skin flare ups but you know from the photo sensitivity and all that but other than that i'm in pretty good spirts uh huh
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;have i ever studied <s> studied what
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh i could still couldn't hear you i'm sorry
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;have i ever studied changes <ch> changes in my behavior what was the word
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;um no
have you been diagnosed with depression;uh uh
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um <sigh> i don't know just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that i enjoy being with and just having a great meal laughing just you know having a good time listening to music
is there anything you regret;regret about my entire life you mean or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about
whatever comes to your mind;mm you know it's funny uh i find that a lot of the negative experiences that in in my life that have happened have also been uh um opened up experiences that are that are also great that i have not overlooked for example i got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole <wh> my whole savings and i've had to start all over again and sometimes people sat to me like are you sure you're okay are you are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you wanna seek revenge if i was you know 'cause my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other's families which was even more difficult in a way um and uh he stole essentially my whole life's savings essentially in a way and he was <w> got sent to prison and the f_b_i was involved interpol was involved uh i was living in switzerland and my father was sick and i was going back and forth and um <tisk> uh but you know if i hadn't get involved hadn't <ha> hadn't gotten involved with him in business i wouldn't have had the a lot of rich experiences and i think sometimes the reason why i don't know why i'm such a positive person but for some reason uh i'm able to it's not that i'm purposely trying to i do see the positiveness in even horrible situations i wouldn't have gotten to live in barcelona and zurich i wouldn't have learned to speak as good spanish german <g> german uh lived in in europe if i had not gotten involved in business with my business partner who ended up ripping me off but and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that i developed during that period of time and in a way it was a total different life uh a different world that that would you know that i would've never um had the chance you know to live through if i had not involved my you know but of course it cost me financially and but then again i've always been the type of person who you know money isn't everything and i think the when i least cared about money is when i made the most of it so there you go
yeah;<laughter> and for example one of my favorite times in my life probably when i lived in kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad vision of it maybe looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively i mean it it's not like that at all but i and you'd think that with the least amount of uh technological <tech> technological innovations and stuff like that i mean actually and i really didn't have you know that much many <m> many material goods at the time i mean i had the blast i had probably the one of the best years of my life when i was living in kenya
mm;the same thing that i did probably when i was about fifteen or sixteen um to live your life with passion and again like choose the way i was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions gut wise what will give you a sense of awe and wonderment what would make you give you joy and you have to it's it's regardless what the percentages are even if you only have a one percent chance of success you have to go towards that 'cause that's the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life
mhm;<tisk> the fact that i've adhered to that and been brazen whatever you wanna say have the balls the chutzpah the cojones to go ahead and follow my passions and you know and i guess people call them sometimes strong decisions usually decisions that are easy <ea> when you where you remain unscathed usually don't yield joy that's just murphy's law that's just the way it is

goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing okay
that's good;i'm from greenwich connecticut
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago
how often do you go back to your hometown;um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less
mhm;um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general
why;um i think that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and it's less superficial
i understand;<tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally
mm;uh fine arts and photography
that sounds interesting;um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art
are you still working in that;um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and scrubbed_entry
awesome;yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um that's a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up
can you tell me about that;um well my family's very close um my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that
that sounds like a great situation;yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries
yeah;um i consider myself more shy
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;um i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted
like what;um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to
okay;um i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger
uh huh;um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago
can you tell me about that;um there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me
yeah;um
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really mm like not say anything
yeah;um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made
okay;um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd wanna like have in my memory
yeah;um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older
mhm;um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer
are they triggered by something;no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning
hmm;<tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday
okay;um i don't know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;i mean nothing like lately um like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no i have been diagnosed with anxiety
what got you to seek help;um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety
do you feel like therapy is useful;i think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah
do you still go to therapy now;no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid
why did you stop;um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasn't i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it
i see what you mean;<sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day
that's great;in general
yes;um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went
yeah;so it kind of create created more problems for me
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<sigh> well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california
how would your best friend describe you;um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and don't really speak much
uh huh;um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that
nice;yeah
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i'm very caring i i'm a very good judge of character which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself um i'm very affectionate <aff> i mean i'm not very affectionate i'm more i mean i guess i guess so
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;thanks
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah
okay;i'm okay
that's good;burbank california
really;yeah
what are some things you really like about l_a;the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather um it's not too city like chicago or new york
mhm;it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost
okay;not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago and i've been to new york a couple times san francisco and i took a road trip across the country that was cool i saw a couple states
nice;seeing new places um going to landmarks that i've only read about or seen pictures of
mhm;um i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time it was the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter>
awesome;happy and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice i haven't felt like that in a long time
that's so good to hear;i was studying film
cool;it's just something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do and um i applied to northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision
that's great;ooh <laughter> um i love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so uh comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but
okay;that's hard <laughter>
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter>
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;i um i like to watch mindless television like um toddlers in tiaras and um duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all
okay;i'm okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part
has that gotten you in trouble;sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um my best friend <laughter> ryan i think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before
how hard is that;really hard it's um he's my best friend and i miss him but we messed up and it's just it's not the same it's like not the same friendship <laughter>
i'm sorry;me too <laughter>
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;<laughter> too many um i guess scrubbed_entry when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i would've just realized that this was bad and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up
could you have done anything to avoid it;i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the e_r and from the e_r i had the choice to i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever
can you tell me about that;um <exhale> it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter> so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me <laughter>
yeah;i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help
that sounds really hard;it was
what got you to seek help;um i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i um got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i don't want to go down that bad path again i just wanna get better so i had to do it i had to get help
do you still go to therapy now;i do i go once a week
do you feel like therapy is useful;i feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we could've gone really far but sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to
aw;i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay she's not we're not that great together but she's who i had right now
okay;it's better than nothing <laughter>
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;not that easy at all
why;um ever since <yawn> i got out of the hospital and start and i began medication for my depression i um just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing
like what;um i guess just sometimes they reflect things that i'm worried about or happening in my life but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen and it's usually no you dreamed that sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up
when was the last time that happened;probably <laughter> like two nights ago
wow;that is a hard question i think in november <yawn> after i got out of the hospital i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool
how would your best friend describe you;<laughter> um probably super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy
is there anything you regret;i try not to regret things in my life
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;oh um i would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad
yeah;um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter> sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends maybe going home with them and bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies watch some t_v have a sleep over and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time
(laughter;go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter>
what are you most proud of in your life;um that is a hard question i mean i think i've done a lot of great things in my life and um i have achieved a lot but i think one of the proudest things proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant i was doing this exercise boot camp and the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like thirty push ups and it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him and i just it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that
that's great;it was nice it meet you <laughter> bye

sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> music music is much therapy for me
can you tell me about that;um well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better
that's so good to hear;i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like blurt out or no i can control it pretty much

yeah;um probably moving here moving to l_a
why;because like i'm i'm really like close <clo> we're really close with our family like i skype with my mom and dad every day so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own it was much it was different

okay;um i wanna say two years ago three years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as i try i don't tell them this 'cause i don't want them to be like i need to you know whatever i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him kinda yeah

that's good;um the weather um i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave
mhm;traffic <laughter>
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah
what do you enjoy about traveling;seeing new places different people the way they live their lives
cool;<tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um it's a good question i'm not really sure uh there's probably
okay;i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter>
what did you study at school;astronomy
that sounds interesting;yeah it was
how did you decide to do that;<tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path
are you still working in that;no
why;there's not much job opportunities so it's kinda limited
that sucks;yeah it does <laughter>
what's your dream job;um my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice a bar restaurant
can you tell me about that;well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd
uh huh;but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible <laughter>
yeah;i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but initially i'm pretty shy
okay;<laughter>
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;good idea um a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book kinda just takes your mind away
mhm;relax
how are you at controlling your temper;i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you know think before you speak that type of thing
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago <laughter>
can you tell me about that;um we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate
how did you feel in that moment;frustrated
yeah;like yeah i guess everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves
uh huh;<tisk> but yeah
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing
mhm;<tisk> um <sigh> leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that
what's something you feel guilty about;mm i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me
yeah;<tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter>
tell me about your relationship with your family;it's good it's very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good
that's good;<tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um probably irritable there's it's harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and
mhm;good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well
that makes sense;no not at all
have you been diagnosed with depression;never
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;<tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy
mhm;i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less so
why;i don't know i i guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter>
mm;don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something
yeah;um i'm just gonna stick to that argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter>
okay;um i i don't know uh when i was when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter>
how did you feel in that moment;stupid <laughter> immature <laughter>
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;<tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends that've been positive influences
that's great;yeah
how would your best friend describe you;mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter> <laughter>
can you tell me about that;well i care a lot and at the same time sometimes it gets the best of me
can you give me an example of that;mm <tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example
i see what you mean;yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<tisk> um focus more on school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and scrubbed_entry
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;mm <tisk> i don't know really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but i felt content after it
(laughter;mm <tisk> not much it's i mean it's kinda sad i don't know uh <laughter> i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know
what would you say are some of your best qualities;i'm very detail oriented organized i like to finish tasks um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that
yeah;but yeah that's that's about it
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;<laughter> cool
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;right on have a good day
goodbye;<sync>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm okay
that's good;uh los angeles <laughter>
really;um i don't know <laughter>
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;um it's kinda dirty but that's to be expected from a big city
yeah;um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um i'm not <n> i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education
how did you decide to do that;i think that it's a really important job um uh i feel like uh because there's kind of uh stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for the world <laughter>
yeah;i don't know <laughter>
okay;no
why;um lack of funds
i see what you mean;um it depends on the people but i'd say that uh generally i'm more shy uh of course with people who i know well like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing
mhm;um play with my dogs uh i don't know uh if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk um if it's not a nice day then or if it's cold out or something then uh maybe watch a show on t_v i like or read a book or something
uh huh;i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper
that's good;um i can't remember i think the last person i argued with was my boyfriend probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter>
okay;um i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like um feeling like you should've made a different decision and i think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter>
yeah;um i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school um uh i mean not getting better grades um i regret uh like getting involved with certain people in the past but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter> that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter>
could you have done anything to avoid it;hm
could you have done anything to avoid it;um uh yeah i mean i mean in the past uh yeah i could've made different decisions i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so
yeah;um i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory but i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped
i'm sorry to hear that;<laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um hm i can't think of any <laughter>
okay;hm i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any
tell me about your relationship with your family;uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um uh not i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends
that's good;um hm i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life uh because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't i mean she made like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it and um she just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence
mhm;uh it's been easy lately uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh lately i have had no problems
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just be anywhere from like groggy to like um really on edge and like um extremely tired <laughter> i don't know
okay;um i have been feeling pretty good i uh i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been in the past so been feeling mostly pretty good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;um i think that i've actually been feeling happier lately i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of like um neutral but i have been feeling more positive lately
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
can you tell me about that;um uh i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like since i was sixteen um for depression and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years thought that i had p_t_s_d but i'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis
did you think you had a problem before you found out;um i'm not sure <laughter>
what were your symptoms;uh i'm <laughter> i don't know
is going to a therapist helping you;yes
how has seeing a therapist affected you;um it's helpful to uh talk someone and have them kind of um guide you in talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something i mean i think sometimes you can do that on your own but uh talking to somebody helps i think
yeah;um hm i'm not sure <laughter>
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;um i'm not sure <laughter>
okay;um i'm not sure <laughter>
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;uh i think i would spend it mostly at home um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit and i'd play with my dogs and uh i'd probably have my boyfriend over um i'd eat food that i like like only food that i like like my favorite foods um watch movie or t_v show that i like um just kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice
mhm;mm i would tell myself to uh to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like sort of lose interest and then uh not do well or as well as i could have so i would tell myself to do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more than i do and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school so i would just tell myself to do good in school probably warn myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time <laughter>
mm;um hm um i think i am proud of myself for not being um bitter and for wanting to uh well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them i try to um or i want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm good thank you
that's good;um i was born in mexico city
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;um about thirty four years ago
that's a long time;yeah <laughter>
how often do you go back to your hometown;um i try to go back once a year but i haven't been in about three years
why;um i haven't had the time and i've traveled to other places but i'm planning on going back probably next year
okay;um well i can't ever see myself moving back to mexico city it's a huge huge city and i like l_a more there's more opportunities and i just feel at home here
why did you move to l_a;my family moved here um i like i said <s> i was very young and my parents moved um to california to work and then we just stayed here
uh huh;um i love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to um but i do love to travel
what do you enjoy about traveling;um just seeing new things meeting people from other countries just um feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation um i just love being  in other places
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um the last trip i took was a seven day cruise and it went to saint thomas barbados saint lucia um saint martin and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um i think <sigh> going to mexico the last time i was there i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures
yeah;uh i consider myself more shy
why;um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable um i'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party
i see what you mean;um i actually studied history
awesome;<laughter>
how did you decide to do that;um i've always been interested in history and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course u_s history so i'm very into uh history
are you still working in that;um i'm actually working in uh the education field
what's your dream job;my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel <laughter> that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do doing um so i would love to do that as a job
mhm;<laughter> <laughter> um i love reading and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising
that's great;um i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend and she actually she has kids i don't and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things um i don't think i've ever made her feel that i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it
yeah;um well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument
hmm;um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i could've just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly um instead of yelling at her too
i see what you mean;oh wow um that's a tough one i think um gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years um although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and i kinda felt by ending the relationship um i would've wasted those last seven years of my life it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did because then i went on to meet um my husband
aw;<laughter>
that's great;thank you
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um well about i would say maybe fifteen years ago i was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them and back at their house um one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and tried i i got scared i yelled he tried to choke me and i thought i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind
yeah;it was
tell me about your relationship with your family;um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we get along pretty well um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents um my dad still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me
(laughter;but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship

why;because when somebody talks to you when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart <sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there

cool;uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like
mhm;um the traffic um it seems like we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really annoyed by our government <laughter>
yeah;by your shoes did you say by your shoes
yes;<laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while
what do you enjoy about traveling;oh just <sigh> it um it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here um it's exciting and it makes me feel like um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day
mhm;well um one of my trips i went uh i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um he had <ha> he was uh uh a sales engineer or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course eh it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and um after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle
yeah;we went to um phuket it's a little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter>
wow;it was interesting yeah yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter>
awesome;mm
what did you study at school;well i'm in school right now and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um i had health problems so um here i am i'm i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c
that's great;yeah i'm happy
what's your dream job;ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and in in a veterinary capacity yeah
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not
that makes sense;yeah
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping um i like like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or a lotta times i can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing
uh huh;ah really good i don't have i would say there's certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or uh even you know yell <laughter>
that's good;<sigh> argued um <sigh> i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument like if we just
whatever comes to your mind;well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i don't know i think scrubbed_entry and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again
okay;but like she never she never confronted me
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;hardest decision <sigh> uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend
how did you decide to do that;uh well it wasn't <sigh> it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i don't know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did
that sounds really hard;it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best
that's good;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the <th> it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh
(laughter;eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter> so i would say that's one decision it it's it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed
yeah;<laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say <sigh> my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what you're saying
uh huh;mm <sigh> can't really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something
mm;and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't
yeah;<sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s> being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but i never feel rested and that's um it's a medical problem of mine
can you tell me about that;well i always feel like i haven't slept for two days and um there are points in in the day i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and and rested but they're short-lived but i sleep a lot i sleep
how have you been feeling lately;uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy yeah
i'm sorry to hear that;well thanks <laughter>
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no <sniffle>
have you been diagnosed with depression;i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um that's that's usually what doctors um like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep
i see;but i do
do you feel down;<sigh> i do <sigh> i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down um i would say that i do feel down sometimes a lotta times but it's not i would say it's reasonable considering the situations that i'm in
okay;uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but um i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've find some great new dish i like i mean what type of happiness are you looking for
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;um <sigh> well i mean right now um my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um
(laughter;you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone um yesterday 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean
nice;you know there's little fun things like that
how would your best friend describe you;<sniffle> uh <sigh> probably um o_c_d <laughter> and um she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her um i think that she would say that i have a good heart um we're very different um and probably that i'm <sigh> i should ask her <laughter> uh i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun um but she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that
why;why um <sigh> i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now and <sigh> so i don't really tell people about them um it it's kind of a it's kind of a killjoy but also people can feel i feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of um it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before even before this difficult time in my life i've been i've been a private person i don't know why i think <thi> i think a lot eh you know i'm a deep thinker and maybe it's just you know not like i feels like i feel abnormal but um maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure
i see;<sniffle> ten or twenty years ago <sigh> um well one thing that i regret right now is um you know i haven't really found somebody you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder that's it
what are you most proud of in your life;um i would say <sigh> that i've perservered i'm very proud that even though i have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school and i'm doing it on my own and um you know it's it's kind of a if people if people knew all the problems that i have they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um i really feel that you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's

(laughter;mm i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission and i had a warranty and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and i decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and i wish i would've have taken the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so i wish i would've taken the higher road than taken the lower road

i'm sorry to hear that;um it's fair to midland
how close are you to your family;mm my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close
okay;my mother
can you tell me about that;um yes uh she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes goals and dreams she always encourages me to always stay aloof and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures

why did you stop;financially i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what i'm telling them

okay;today is a wonderful day i am doing just absolutely marvelous
that's so good to hear;i was born in cleveland ohio i was raised in tucson arizona and came to los angeles when i was sixteen years old
really;yes
how often do you go back to your hometown;mm uh i've only been back once since i left
how does it compare to l_a;it's a whole another community when i was growing up i'm so glad i grew up there because it was a great sense of community which i think we don't have here in los angeles <sniffle>
yeah;uh my my grandmother died and left property for my father so we came here to manage her property property
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;uh it was pretty easy for me i was still young and it was easy to adapt so i'm pretty good at meeting people so uh that has never been a problem i traveled a lot as a child so i was used to moving and going to new places
that's good;meeting new people seeing new things it's an adventure and i like the adventurous life
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;oh one of my best trips i had it was in nineteen i'm dating myself but nineteen sixty four <sniffle> i came out here to visit my grandmother from cleveland ohio and i went to an indian reservation and i got a little note card about the reservation when i got back home i wrote to the reservation and i told them i when i came <ca> went back to school in september i would have to write uh deliver a speech rather about what i did over the summer and i told them i wanted to talk about going to the indian reservation and would they send me something and they sent me this huge kachina indian doll and that was <wa> that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if i still had it i found out like a quarter of a million dollars so
wow;<laughter>
awesome;mm but that's one of the best xxx
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;um i could be a little bit of both um i'm pretty when i have to be i can be outgoing 'cause i'm good at meeting <mee> talking to people and meeting people but sometimes i have a little bashful side a little shy side of me too so so a little bit of both
i understand;i studied business administration <ad> administration with a uh emphasis in marketing and advertising
how did you decide to do that;um well i really i started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn't this what it is today and um i liked <li> i was good at it but it wasn't any interaction with people and i love people so i wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so i went into marketing and i was working for a t_v station where i was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so
that's great;no now i'm a photographer i'm a celebrity photographer i shoot a lot of stars i shoot on the red carpet i shoot a lot of special events and anything else people will pay me for <laughter>
how hard is that;it's not hard at all it's my passion i love it it's like not working
what's your dream job;i'm in my dream job i i just need to get more jobs <j> jobs to that pay pay me well because there's a lot of times as a photographer you have to do a lot of things <thin> events for free to get known so it's a building process of relationships so i'm still in that process of building relationships
mhm;so that i can get more paid jobs but this is my dream job i love what i do
okay;<laughter> well now i'm really back into it i used to do it a while then i got away from it but it's meditation i practice meditation and i try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before i go to sleep i work with oprah and deepak chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and i use that to calm my body
how are you at controlling your temper;um i can generally control my temper sometimes i get set off i guess like any other human person <per> being but i work at trying to keep a moderate and temperate uh temper in personality
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh wow we i argued with my daughter the other day about something i said and i did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her mm and maybe what i said did and that's what started the argument
how did you feel in that moment;oh god i felt terrible because i i never intended to hurt my daughter and i never would wanna hurt her and i felt bad that she had been hurt by what i had said so i had to have to guard my words and watch my thoughts
tell me about your relationship with your family;well i don't have much of a relationship with my family <f> with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it's just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughter's a makeup artist and i'm a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes i think we're up on each other too close we need a little more space
has that gotten you in trouble;yeah when i say the wrong things <laughter> it's
do you find it easy to be a parent;no it's never easy to be a parent it's a work in progress
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;making the right decisions about things sometimes
what's the best thing about being a parent;the love the feel the feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a a uh wonderful and productive human being
yeah;i'm not as strict as my parents were i give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are um i'm not real religious like they do but i am very spiritual um so i brought them up different from me on the religious tip and um i'm more i listen more to them i think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when i was growing up and i let my kids' voice be heard
what's something you feel guilty about;one night i had a bad night that changed my life and i don't know wanna go into details i feel bad about that night <laughter>
could you have done anything to avoid it;yeah i could've stayed home <laughter>
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;wow i'm trying to think about a situation maybe the handling of how i me and my husband divorced i think i could've handled that a little differently
can you tell me about that;well we we i think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to a a end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and i think both of us could've handled it better but i think i played a part in in keeping a lot of drama going 'cause i was hurt that we were breaking up and kinda devastated 'cause i wanted my child to be raised with her father so i think it looking back now which is you know hindsight is twenty twenty vision i could've handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you'd do better
yeah;the hardest decision i've ever had to make the hardest decision i've ever had to make was i was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on a plane had a stroke was going to make an a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that i could not get on that plane because i might have another stroke that was a hard decision 'cause i was in dallas texas all by myself i did not i mean i was in there with an employee but i would be left all by myself 'cause my employees had to go on to montgomery alabama where we were headed and i had to make a decision should i stay or should i go but my life was in the balance so i made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one <sniffle>
oh my gosh;ugh overwhelmed i mean here i am on my way to work you know i flew to different states every week and uh to help kids get get admitted into college and here i am on my way to work and i'm on a plane and i feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and i say my prayers and i go to sleep and then when i wake up to get off the plane i can't remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which i did every week so i knew something was wrong it was it was when you to your life and the whole world in your hand and you don't know what's gonna happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and i you know you don't know what's happening to you it's so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience
yeah;yeah but i'm here i you know i survived it the doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and i survived so the universe wasn't finished with me yet
mhm;you know what that's sometimes i have a little problem with it um sleeping a little bit sometimes i i get wired up <laughter> i get wired up just because i'm one of those real energetic persons and i have to finish what i set out to do and until i finish i can't go to sleep so sometimes it's hard for me to go to sleep other times i can lay down and just go but depends on what's going on in my head
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um i'm sluggish um probably a little on edge but i try and keep a a upbeat personality i'm a real energetic person so i try to but you know if you're tired your body is still talking to you so
uh huh;lately i've been feeling really well um except i've been having some problems because i have a um since i had the stroke i have nerve damage in my hand and in my face and so i just it's i thought it's been over a year since i had the stroke but i thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it hasn't but i'm so grateful to be alive that that is really minor <mi> minor compared to the bigger picture and i wasn't fortunately <for> fortunately my i didn't lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are i still can use my hands i still can shoot with my camera even though my left hand is is diminished in use but i can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so i can still keep doing my work um so you know i have to keep a good upbeat energy going on for me to keep for me to be successful
yeah;no but i went through depression uh from being knocked unconscious five times when i was a school teacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and i suffered from having like sleep apnea and not being able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head so
okay;no only i don't go to therapy because um i don't i don't have any medical right now so i'm not able to get therapy they only offer that to people with medical it's hard to get it <sniffle> and then i don't i'm not working <work> yeah it sucks i'm not working right now because i'm still trying to get my disability
yeah;so that i can get well 'cause i wanna be a fulfilled human being and i wanna be totally and you know the system it'll be almost two years before i go for a hearing so that's kind of depressing to think after all the years i've been working since i was sixteen and it's taking me it's been over a year it was a year i had the stroke february two thousand twelve and we are now in march of two thousand thirteen and i won't have a hearing until september two thousand thirteen just to tell me if i get the disability or not that's been very depressing for me because i'm wondering where i lived off my savings in the last year and i got put my daughter through college she finished and now she's having to take care of me and she's still looking for a job and my life is kinda up in the air right now 'cause i'm wondering what comes next and so i'm just praying for guidance <sniffle>
yeah;i feel happy every day every day i wake up and i can breathe and i can see and i can walk and i can talk and i can still shoot my photograph i'm happy it's just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive <sniffle>
that's so good to hear;mm you know what i figured like what good are regrets you can't change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just live <li> move forward
mhm;mm what advice would i give myself <sniffle> don't let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality and a energetic spirit and just keep pushing
how would your best friend describe you;energetic talkative uh won't take no for an answer uh follow through reliable um good spirited giving loving
mhm;um i'm most proud of that i have been able to find out my creative side i've been a visual artist i never took a art lesson before i taught art <sniffle> um i was in my late twenties before i even discovered that i could draw and paint um i'm a doll collector uh i'm i'm my creative side is what i'm most proud of because it's been able to help me being creative i can no matter what even when i i was still very ill from having a stroke i could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to my soul that i'm i'm i'm glad that i have a creative side and that i found it and have utilized it
that's great;mhm
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;uh huh and that's is that it bye bye
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm okay i'm feeling a little tired and uh worried

i'm sorry to hear that;i'm staying with my son in venice
how do you like your living situation;uh it's pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live
i understand;originally from new york but i've been in california since the early seventies so
that's a long time;yeah
why did you move to l_a;uh i moved to l_a because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;um it wasn't too hard i uh i met people right away and um i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people
that's good;the weather is <laughter> number one like for most people i love being near the ocean um i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;mhm uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel <fee> i feel the same way um
(laughter;sometimes it it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult
yeah;uh no not as much as i'd like if if i had more funds <fu> more income more funds i would travel more
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um <sigh> well mostly i've been um xxx i traveled let's see so my longest uh trip that was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca and the whole trip we took about mm i think we took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area
wow;um yeah that was a fun trip
how did you decide to do that;well uh we'd been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their uh loved ones who have passed away and um they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that
awesome;uh well i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didn't stay <st> i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities
what's your dream job;huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to uh travel and go to events with them
how hard is that;uh it's hard to break into um i i'm starting now very uh minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a volunteer work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that
that's good;i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so um i i'm you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i don't hold back and um you know xxx just i'm not shy <sh> like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people um but i i am overall kind of introverted so um i prefer one-on-one than big groups
okay;um i like to watch uh well i <laughter> i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh h_g_t_v i like to watch um like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies or read oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire
okay;um i don't usually realize i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up um and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where um those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road um i get a little annoyed uh i don't get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they <the> you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry in return
yeah;hmm <sigh> um yeah like i said i don't really get into arguments um i did have <ha> i was with a friend the other day and um she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her so it wasn't really an argument but she you know i had said something that she heard as a correction well it was a correction and she got angry um but
how did you feel in that moment;um well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable eh i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable
hmm;hmm um well i in that situation i didn't i didn't have to correct her um so <sigh> i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right so in general that's i'm trying to to catch that and just let people make mistakes without <laughter> without my telling them about it
mhm;mm hmm boy i don't know um gee that's tough i can't i don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions um hmm well uh <u> uh was hard for me to decide to uh put my cat to sleep when he was sick oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat um when i was moving once and and that was difficult too 'cause
i'm sorry to hear that;um <sigh> well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um i decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision um and with the cat i had to give up i didn't i didn't really decide um i was moving to a place that where i couldn't take her and so i i found somebody who could take her
i see;hmm <sigh> mm see um gee that's tough <sigh> if i don't really eh the the erasing from the memory part um there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory um trying to think of something that i've done that i wish i hadn't done um oh okay i remember something there was <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was i was in a class at junior college it was a film class and uh i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project um and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never brought them the film back so all the work they had done um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that
oh no;eh it's pretty easy um sometimes i wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often

how long ago were you diagnosed;uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy two nineteen <ninetee> yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um another time um oh so then when would that've been about sixteen years ago
what got you to seek help;um just feeling like there wasn't um you know feeling that feeling that things weren't gonna change if i didn't get some help and that if i i didn't have to you know that maybe if some <s> i got some medication that would help me um in the short term so

do you feel like therapy is useful;i feel like therapy can be useful yes
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;well when i went to therapy um it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way i was feeling
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;<deep breath> um <sigh> well i was on the beach last weekend uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and i felt very happy and content
that sounds like a great situation;uh i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener and i'm intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas
mhm;um <sigh> well i wish that uh sometimes i wish i was <wa> i was a harder worker um i'm not really willing to take low wage jobs even though i i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything um and um i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and i'm good at the uh the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then i don't take them the distance
uh huh;that's probably the the thing i'd like to change about myself the most
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;uh ten or twenty years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree finish my education um and be willing to um to work a regular job and to um to start putting money away for my uh retirement

that's great;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm alright
that's good;south l_a
really;um the weather the women the opportunities
mhm;that's about it
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;racism police brutality injustice
yeah;that's it
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;mm no
why;not much of a exploring type of person
okay;um psychology
cool;mhm
how did you decide to do that;um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology
are you happy you did that;yeah yes
are you still working in that;no
what's your dream job;to own my own record label
nice;um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused
yeah;a little bit of both
why;um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with
uh huh;yeah
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music
that's good;mhm
how are you at controlling your temper;i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be
has that gotten you in trouble;yes ma'am
can you tell me about that;um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah
okay;mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life
mm;um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah
how did you feel in that moment;uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning
yeah;there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely
yeah;yeah
what's something you feel guilty about;<sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well
okay;um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent
that's great;mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother
can you tell me about that;um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother
yeah;mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah sure
okay;i'm fine thank you
that's good;i am from los angeles
really;well you can't beat the weather um and i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here
mhm;smog uh rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude
i see what you mean;um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no
what do you enjoy about traveling;i just think seeing different places it's um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest
mhm;um let's see i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat
(laughter;too many to mention i i don't even know where to start
okay;suppose it depends on the situation
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;um i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax
okay;<sigh> in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;ah probably argued with my roommate <psh> couple days ago but uh that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will
how do you know them;uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of um kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along
that's good;it's cool i mean guess you know like we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool
that's so good to hear;hmm how much time do we have uh <laughter> it's just too numerous to mention um i i i wouldn't know how to answer that
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work um that was very difficult
what made you decide to do that;just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasn't going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over
yeah;no
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that
what's something you feel guilty about;the same girl that i broke up with she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine uh they were separated for for several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i i would've handled that better
okay;<scoff>
tell me about your relationship with your family;um it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;my older sister
can you tell me about that;um she's just strong no nonsense uh she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh uh she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way
that's great;uh suppose it depends on my stress level um when i have a lot on my mind i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep
mm;crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um tired listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well
yeah;i feel good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;mm no not really um no no i i wouldn't say i have
okay;no i have not
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes i have
how long ago were you diagnosed;i was diagnosed probably about about five years ago
what got you to seek help;i think uh i always knew there was a problem i always knew there was some i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help
what were your symptoms;think just uh lethargy uh uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there um think normal depression type things uh um social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was you know quite talkative <laughter>
hmm;i do
do you feel like therapy is useful;i'm sorry say again

that's great;photography
what's your dream job;uh i think i'm doing it you know
how hard is that;i really <re> i i really believe i'm doing it um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it uh and um i connect well with people
mhm;i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be um you know a little more pulled back <laughter> uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think
i understand;an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect
yeah;okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it's uh something great happening there even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know
yeah;mhm
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know
how are you at controlling your temper;uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again i don't really dwell on negative things too much
mm;uh
what's something you feel guilty about;um i don't have any regrets right now mm
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;i really can't think of anything right off the top
okay;the hardest decision i've ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they weren't qualified for that's hard
can you tell me about that;uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence
yeah;my father
can you tell me about that;uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so
yeah;mhm
tell me about your relationship with your family;um it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh my distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can mm yeah
why;uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know uh it's nothing like mhm yeah
that makes sense;mhm
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;uh well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it
mhm;well uh i guess i'll be a little bit uh uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm
okay;i feel okay now
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh changes like what
whatever comes to your mind;mm well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes
that's good;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;never
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;uh i feel okay now
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;uh i went to a great party last week that was really cool
nice;yeah
tell me more about that;well it was like on a rooftop uh and a a lot to really uh nice people who are basically in the same kind of uh mindset uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made
that's great;mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome
tell me how you spend your ideal weekend;my ideal weekend is uh cooking my own food relaxing you know and if i'm in the mood for company you know i have friends and uh you know uh family members join me
uh huh;well i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work i eat like crazy and nothing happen
(laughter;mm well you know i i think people in general sometime uh uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a if a different set of things make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know
yeah;yeah
what would you say are some of your best qualities;uh my best qualities probably um uh listening i think <mumbling> and uh maybe just uh talking uh you know on a conversational level
mhm;uh
is there anything you regret;yeah sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but uh you know i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;uh uh go for your dream believe in what you're doing don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself
mm;most proud of um i think my um my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really uh never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently

i understand;i studied automotive technology
cool;and welding
what made you decide to do that;just a passion for cars since i was little uh always basically just wanted to work on cars pretty
are you happy you did that;yeah i really love working on cars
that's so good to hear;my dream job would probably be probably to own my own automotive shop or to own a barber shop or to just basically be a probably a master welder
okay;consider myself a little more outgoing
why;just because i like having fun being uh just having fun with my friends being able to do anything i please
uh huh;basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or just lay down watch a movie listen to some music
like what;basically hip hop music or maybe a good comedy movie
nice;uh fairly easy about it i don't really let go get let my bad side get to my emotions
that's good;probably earlier today about with my girlfriend or wife basically about where we gonna go eat
how did you feel in that moment;felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat since she wouldn't make up her mind kinda made me uneasy
i see what you mean;probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice
what's something you feel guilty about;wrongdoings in my past basically anything i could've changed mm to better myself
can you give me an example of that;basically uh doing something better at a job that or maybe uh not doing the job at my greatest
okay;hardest decision would have to be uh to plan a family probably
can you tell me about that;uh just basically making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and talking it out with my partner if we're really ready to begin a family <clears throat>
what made you decide to do that;just basically the love and bond between me and my wife
aw;um basically might be like a crash accident
can you tell me about that;uh basically pretty horrific scary experience when uh i almost crashed into the freeway barrier and the car spun out and it basically almost ended up off of a little hill
wow;it was a pretty scary experience as far as just uh being in a car by myself not being able to control the vehicle at all and just hoping that i was gonna be okay
yeah;it's fairly easy except <exc> if as long as i've had a good dinner early on in my day fairly would go to sleep pretty good

mhm;mm they're pretty fun they're outbursting minds basically just smarter kinda seem more advanced thinking compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the the old age
mm;they learn things a little more quicker
right;uh no not majorly just things that i could've thought i could've done better or or just a little differently
like what;uh like building my car differently um getting traffic violations basically just uh kinda wish i wouldn'ta sped through intersections or gotten all those tickets i've received on my record
that sucks;yeah i would've basically just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again so the same mistake doesn't happen
okay;uh just my persona kind of as far as uh whenever i'm angry just to find a way to be more easygoing maybe try to not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder <clears throat>
mhm;uh basically when somebody accuses you of wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done
can you give me an example of that;um basically when a police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done anything wrong
yeah;probably earlier this year
can you tell me about that;basically a police officer pulled me over for thinking that i was a drunk driver made me feel really really dumb about myself or tried to accuse me of wrongdoing that i've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause i was just very tired that night it was twelve a_m therefore i was trying i was i looked probably a little sleepy

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes i am
okay;i'm doing very good today
that's good;i'm originally from chicago illinois moved out here when i was three
really;yes
how often do you go back to your hometown;i never go back
why;family issues
i see what you mean;it depends on what you're into if you're into um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun
mhm;i'll
why did you move to l_a;my mom and my dad split up
i'm sorry;<laughter> it's okay
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here
okay;i like the sunshine i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood i like that the lakers are here and and
(laughter;<laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a
yeah;oh gang violence
i understand;<laughter> no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances
yeah;i studied alcohol and drug counseling
cool;i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so um that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and i just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and i finished school and did a intership and got hired and so i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life
are you still working in that;i'm not working right now i actually moved away and i had to <deep breath> i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um in order to make that move but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling
how hard is that;well it can be it can be very difficult at times because um i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly and but the regular dopes i can and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard
mm;<laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility um or or as an author
cool;you know that depends <de> that depends on on on people mainly i mainly adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up but if people open up right away then i open up right away
uh huh;<laughter> i i mainly listen to music or i watch youtube write poetry um or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't so <laughter> that's
(laughter;and another thing i do is i eat ice cream <laughter>
nice;controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that
yeah;well i was just telling you about um it was it was my mother's husband and to tell you the truth um i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um that i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should've just left i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i can't get back
hmm;yes
tell me about your relationship with your family;well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother and um my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and i have family in chicago but i don't mess around with that side of the family just just because um of what i seen and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance
mm;someone who's been a positive influence <inf> influence in my life i would say scrubbed_entry taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and taught taught me how how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um and of course um he's he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget
that's so good to hear;feel guilty about my grandfather um passed away in two thousand four and at that time i was just getting out of prison um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then and
yeah;i feel i think about it all the time
okay;something i can erase from my memory huh would be the day my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like that's one memory i just i can just go without replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there
how did you feel in that moment;i felt conflicting feelings because on one hand
like what;on one hand my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was hitting my mom so was kinda in the middle
yeah;uh most nights i don't i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep
what are you like when you don't sleep well;it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep
i see what you mean;how i been feeling lately i just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me um making some better decisions um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes i don't care if i get five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before um the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering
that's good;my behavior i'm more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh and the um acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm you know um back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you to feel the same way
okay;no no i haven't
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game
awesome;<laughter> yeah
how would your best friend describe you;my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth
why;because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and
wow;yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um i wish i would've never well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um i wish that i could change well um my economic status my employment status and um my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be um confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says are they looking at my teeth so i would really change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it
okay;twenty years ago which would make me eighteen i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i could've been playing for the lakers last night but hey
yeah;i'm most proud of the fact that you know what i'm most proud of my mom really really um she graduated from school she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at five in the morning go to work get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this you know when they say xxx that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so i'm just real proud of that and um her life has been affecting people in a in a positive way so yeah my mom

okay i think i have asked everything i need to;oh you're welcome
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing pretty good
that's good;i was born and raised right here in los angeles
really;<sigh> um the weather um would be number one i also like the diverse uh cultures i like the fact that there's a lot of different things here you can do and there's a lot of opportunity here um not just for myself but for my kids and um i think it's really a great place to be when you're trying to establish a career go to school um learn about different people
yeah;the traffic the cost of living um sometimes i think it's too big and i think the transportation system as far as the bus and trains um is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation
i see what you mean;i travel when i can a little bit here and there i have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so i've just traveled domestically i try to take at least one trip a year somewhere
that's good;i just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places um going particularly somewhere i've never been and learning about that place you know like so if i'm going to d_c i really look forward to it 'cause it's a historic city you know things like that
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um my most recent trip would've been d_c <laughter> last year um i went to go visit a friend and i stayed about three <thr> i think three to four days and i got to see the capitol um he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the white house the capitol building um i got to see a lot of other different uh government buildings and um it was it was a a good experience the irony was i had to fly on nine eleven and so that had me a little uneasy but once i was in the plane up in the air i was okay and it was all good and once i was back home i was like yes but i i i miss the trip and i look forward to going back
nice;um attending uh my friend's wedding she had a destination wedding in hawaii um actually maui that was actually two three three years ago three years ago in august and um i've been trying to get back ever since and i wanna take my kids and i just love it there and i actually kinda look forward to to moving there one day
tell me about your kids;um i have three sons um thirteen-year-old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he's eight they um all have birthdays in june the twins are june ninth and my baby is june fourth and so they're just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they're just super super typical boys active all over the place hormones puberty um so it's actually an interesting time because you know the the two older boys are going through puberty um they're teenage years um my youngest um still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of eight to nine years old so he'll be nine in june and then my oldest will be fourteen so it's a challenging time for me as well
what's the best thing about being a parent;just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent every day and seeing how just with love and nurturing and um the right and you know well i can't say proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a um baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and then into a young man and so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and seeing how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they're going through now that so reminiscent of my teenage years and um it's just it's very rewarding and um actually i look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and off in college 'cause i really love children and giving back
aw;um mm there's probably a couple of things but i would just say um for me being a single parent is um the financial um well i would say that along with some of the emotional with <w> with them having um to bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing um you know the just the everyday things of what you have to deal with the uh sometimes when you're just tired you don't wanna be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that oh okay i gotta cook or i have to go pick my son up or i have to take him to baseball practice uh this one want to go over here um this one is acting moody and you know just those those types of challenges um as well as the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you're keeping up with the day to day and that's those two are probably the hardest things um for me to deal with
yeah;well i just um i take it day by day i just put one foot in front of the other and um i'm extremely spiritual so i just rely on god and pray a lot and meditate um if i see i need a little help if if you know i'm i'm i'm not above asking for help so sometimes if i have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you know i try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better um economic situation so i can continue to provide for them comfortably
mhm;um i studied communications actually i was a um journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now i'm studying business <laughter>
what made you decide to do that;i just thought that you know um there would be more opportunities for me with business um as far as jobs and then i you know have a desire to go to graduate school so i just figured in the long run it was a better um it would put me in a better position give me more opportunities um with the communications it's a little limited and especially as you get older um the fields of t_v reporting and things like that um are kinda become you know harder to obtain so i just thought eh i would go into something more realistic and um you know but uh i like both fields i really do i like communicating writing reading talking as you can tell and um so we'll see
what's your dream job;um <laughter> a couple probably but i would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer um going to different destinations um trying different foods out um writing about different people cultures um learning and living you know uh about those different people and cultures living <l> living amongst <am> amongst the you know the the people there and um being interactive with the children and stuff like that so i kinda hope to be able to do that one day but yes um it it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor social worker something in that area if i could encompass all three hopefully i can i i would like to do that
mhm;um that's actually a hard question probably because i initially grew up very shy and um not so much shy as i am reserved now um but not conservative but just reserved and you know when i go somewhere i'm checking everything everybody else out and then once i become comfortable or acclimate to the situation then i'm like okay you know i warm up to the to the situation or the people but i'm also friendly i can be very friendly and outgoing i like to talk um you know i seem like a chatterbox but i'm not really so usually if i'm in a big space with a whole lot of people i don't like to be the center of attention <atten> attention i can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but i i overall i am a open friendly person
mhm;<laughter> um for me um it it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture um if i'm able to i like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial um you know things that will i kinda like the physical part part of it i like massages things that really release tension um and if not then just like i said just sitting at home reading and praying or i like the beach i love the beach so sometimes i drive and go sit by the beach i like <li> also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that
okay;mm pretty good sometimes i'm just like grr i don't really have so much a issue with the temper as i am i just i'm more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so i just can become really irritated or irritable um quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me i just lose patience um outside of that i'm actually pretty good i try to be very you know conscious of where i'm at and be very patient with people especially if i could see that the person is like if if they're a new <n> a new checkout person at the the counter or cashier i do try to be i do try to be patient and understanding 'cause i would want that you know if it were me i would want someone to extend that to me
mm;um you know with my kids sometimes you know it's this it works both ways too once it's that time of the month i'm just like ugh just leave me alone um or i might have a short temper or a short fuse so i am conscious of it i try to be aware of it and and try to monitor it but you know like anybody i'm human and there are times or i have my days or moments when i could just like ugh go off and just lose it
yeah;um <sigh> well i haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been a ongoing thing with american express so i would say because it was not a personal contact but a company i eh we it it really was an argument but uh you know i i had some um issues with american express i had to call in about on i think saturday and i kept um i wasn't getting the response i expected and so i would get the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and i was upset and you know the rep was trying to overtalk me then i was trying to overtalk her so you <y> you know i don't know if you would consider that an argument but i would definitely say that's the last time when you know i just kinda like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and eh that <th> that was the closest you know to an argument and then i had to call back this morning that one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was um a a a tense exchange for a minute or two
i see;probably the most recent contact and that would've been the one on saturday with american express um or actually it was on sunday yeah and um i know the person was trying to help me but you know when you you're constantly being told different things and i've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so um just i kept raising my voice said some things i shouldn't had um and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact i like to really feel in control of the contact and so um it just took me there my blood pressure was raised <clears throat> excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe thirty minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and and so i always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how i could you know handle things differently but that's one i i definitely wish i could've kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raised my voice and you know um been more polite
okay;<sigh> mm well i've probably have had a couple but <clears throat> probably the most is a situation years ago when i just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and i was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and um it just was not a good time and he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and um i wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but he put me under so much stress and you know kind of i wanna say really pushed me into having terminating the the pregnancy and that's always stayed with me and i've always missed that pregnancy that child i think about that that baby or what could've been i try not to hold any um anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it but i know deep down inside secretly if i had it to do all over again i would've just i would've kept the baby and moved forward so that would've been probably the hardest especially emotionally i could deal with a lot and i have dealt with a lot you know um being unemployed or you know lot of financial problems but that to me was the hardest
i'm sorry to hear that;thank you
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no mm mm
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
how have you been feeling lately;um okay you know um i was laid off in december so i've been constantly trying to do things to you know get um back on my feet so that's been a little tough i've had i've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so i my <m> my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place um about five years ago well she's been able to move forward and um go on with her life and now she's graduating in next month from u_s_c with her master's in social work so i'm feeling a little envious of that and i have been for like the past year but more so recently although i've very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it but xxx of course deep down inside i wish it was me so that too has kinda been bothering me
i understand;well i'm really good with um people i communicate well i like to talk i'm really good with children that's why i would like to teach or be a counselor um although i haven't not really tapped into it i know i'm a very creative person um i know i write pretty good um i could possibly be a creative writer but i know i'm very creative so if given the opportunity i know i could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with maybe songwriting um fiction writing um but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything 'cause i love music i love the arts i love drama i love plays um i'm not a big fashion buff but i do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so um i think those would are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people i know i would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time i have a good ear for listening i'm a great mediator and i know how to because i've been through a lot and one of my friends called me the voice of reason the one that's actually graduating from s_c but um i know i'm like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom and i don't know if it has to do with you know having older parents myself or how i grew up or i had i had very traditional southern parents um who instilled a lot of great values in me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign i'm a pisces but um i'm i'm really good with people just you know period you know like i said i have my moments but i i know if it if it's something i could go into and develop i would do well
uh huh;mm not really some of the situations um i wish i would've waited to maybe have gotten married before i had children um picked a different partner um and i say that i mean my son's father is great but um a great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me we're not together we haven't been together in years but i'm just saying overall i think um had i yeah i think i would say if i could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when i should have and not following my my dreams and goals and doing things as i kinda was planning initially and i think that's that would i honestly be the one thing i could say i regret is not following my goals and and finishing school on time and and pursuing what i really wanted to do
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;stay focused and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you
mhm;mm um i think i'm pretty stable and consistent just with overall i think um how i face adversity how i face <f> i face things you know um i am a pretty committed person i try to you know if i say imma do something i try to stick to it i'm a very loyal friend um and um i'm proud of the fact that i've i've maintained and done a pretty good job with raising my kids solo
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;great thank you
goodbye;bye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing fine
that's good;i'm from los angeles and born in los angeles
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;uh you have a lot of places to go a lot of people to see a lot of things to do
mhm;smog uh the environmental has changed over the years uh xxx i've been around since nineteen fifty two and
wow;i was born here in los angeles and i see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and mm basically that's about it
i see what you mean;i've been to several <s> uh several places in the united states yes
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh trying different type of cuisines uh i like to go to museum like the historical i'm a historical buff i um just uh going somewhere different than uh where i've been here all my life
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh let me start with uh well try boston i had never been to boston before and when i went um i was able to look at the historical uh the buildings and i went to um uh i saw um um eh the lake charles and the and the boats and stuff and it it was just it was a good experience and um there's another place i went to i took a ferry and it and i my mind went on blank on it um god i can't even think of it right now um but other than that uh new orleans i've been to new orleans i didn't go to the mardi gras it's just i don't like to go and it uh to mardi gras when they have a lot of people um i just went on a off season uh i enjoyed that and i've been to atlanta georgia and i have taken a cruise uh i've went to the caribbeans and i took the mexico cruise uh i my next cruise i'd like to go to is alaska because i want to be able to see uh certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet as far as the environmental
that's great;um i'm outgoing as far as uh going places i don't have a problem um eating alone um i don't have a problem meeting people um i'm only shy in conversing back and forth to a stranger <laughter>
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;oh i have a favorite thing uh i like to go on the internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um getting married and having my children <laughter>
aw;mm
tell me about your kids;i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and i've been married for thirty three years
mhm;and um basically uh marriage pretty strong
that's so good to hear;you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to 'em and find out what's going on and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law
yeah;uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off
that's great;and i i basically he treats her well
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel so i've made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it
okay;i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other people's feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of
yeah;um <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um that i can think of that's recent
how did you feel in that moment;i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter>
right;which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because
that sucks;it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again
yeah;and it didn't make any sense
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive
yeah;um let me see the hardest it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything
that sounds really hard;yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on
that makes sense;and um he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call
mhm;and that's it
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well pretty good
how have you been feeling lately;um i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental
how do you cope with them;um exercise walk walking more so
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;no not really
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing
that's so good to hear;oh uh resource person i've been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it
uh huh;and that gives me satisfaction
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh not happy with my weight that's it yeah
mhm;i'm sorry didn't hear you
is there anything you regret;um no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;um let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early
what are you most proud of in your life;most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter>
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;you're welcome
goodbye;bye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm okay thank you
that's good;um i was born in east los angeles and
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day
mhm;i like that
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog
i see what you mean;mm not not frequently but i have
what do you enjoy about traveling;meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent
wow;um human development
how did you decide to do that;um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it
that's good;um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry
nice;well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three
do you find it easy to be a parent;no
what's the best thing about being a parent;um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages
like what;so
yeah;um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way
mhm;tremendously
how close are you to your family;very close <clears throat>
that's good;outgoing
why;mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter>
uh huh;um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax
that's great;i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on
yeah;like exercising or something
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him
how did you feel in that moment;uh really tired of talking about that same topic
can you tell me about that;um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting
that sounds really hard;um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter>
okay;um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling
okay;hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not
can you tell me about that;yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision
what made you decide to do that;um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that
i'm sorry to hear that;not hardly ever
why;<laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard

what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope
that's good;um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail
how would your best friend describe you;um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal

i see what you mean;originally i'm from detroit michigan
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;uh back in the eighties
that's a long time;yeah
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh it's been a while the last time uh it's been about five years
how does it compare to l_a;<laughter> uh not even close uh <sigh> more setback uh out here it's you know you have the weather that's that's that's prominent <pr> prominent reason for coming is the weather
why did you move to l_a;it does uh well maybe better opportunities uh and the weather <laughter>
are you happy you did that;yes <sigh>
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;it took a minute uh had to adjust to <tisk> the uh different attitudes of the people the surroundings the locations and the vast area that someone had to cover to get to one spot to another
yeah;um well the weather uh for one the never end uh uh uh it never snows in in southern california uh two uh the prospects of uh uh starting out a business or becoming uh self-employed and doing what i like to do
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;the people
can you tell me about that;they're not friendly for no no one's friendly out here you know uh back east and i'm from uh i was raised in the south where everybody is uh cordial friendly hi when you pass in the streets out here people think that you have uh uh some agenda just for saying hello in passing so that's what i don't like about l_a
yeah;used to uh i used to be on the road a lot i was a a truck driver and plus uh a entertainment uh coach driver for several uh motown bands back in the day so yeah so i'm used to traveling yes yeah
awesome;well this is a beautiful <beau> this is actually a beautiful country so just viewing uh uh the countryside uh visiting different towns different cultures uh different towns uh and seeing how basically how the rest of the uh the country uh uh lives
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh some not so good some bad uh and some good um let's see denver colorado i lived in denver for a couple years which is uh really a great uh uh city uh and then i lived in uh atlanta which is uh uh really a great state where is you know you have the southern attitude <a> a southern attitude southern attitude which is everybody's friendly and gets along and and let's see i've been back and forth across this country at least sixteen to twenty times so yeah it's it's been it's been it's been an adventure
what's one of your most memorable experiences;<laughter> uh arkansas little rock where i had to get into a uh you might wanna say a a altercation with the rednecks down there because as as you know um i'm african american and down there they're very prejudiced you know they're the uh uh southern uh uh uh which what were the rebels uh not rebels but uh what were they uh confederates they still have this uh uh tendency of thinking blacks or any other culture besides whites aren't uh valuable people
oh no;yeah so it i had a incident down there where it actually turned into a shoot out but i'm okay
okay;a little of both it it depends on it depends on the time on the period it depends on what mood i'm in at the time you know i can be outgoing 'cause i do uh like to go to  nightclubs and listen to live music live bands and i know like i said i uh i did some entertainment before so at clubs i'm more outgoing in social events more shy
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> meditate
that's great;very good very good because uh if i let my temper get the best of me i uh tend to um cause more harm than good you know uh harm to the person harm to myself by you know uh physical altercations or um going to jail and so yeah i'm very good at uh controlling my emotions my temper
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;good question uh okay girlfriend <laughter> uh we just recently broke up about two three weeks ago because of a argument about what she thought she could do and what i know she couldn't do and she wanted to do it anyway so uh that led to a argument and the argument ended in us breaking up so yeah
how hard is that;it was emotional uh but um i'm fifty five and it's not my first break up so i just take it in stride and and move on
mhm;uh well it's it's probably it's no one no no situation actually can be i feel uh at the time when you when you deal with a situation at any particular time there's probably always a better way to handle it after the fact but uh i would say back in the day back in the eighties when me and my  wife broke up i think i could've handled that one better because i was younger more hot tempered and more irrational so i could've handled that one better yes
what made you decide to do that;what the uh uh the way i broke the way i handled that situation
yeah;well like i said uh being young and and inexperienced and and emotions and and attitudes and uh not being able to communicate with another person on the level of of understanding
okay;<laughter> hmm leaving home
can you tell me about that;well it was like <sigh> what can i say it was about one o'clock two o'clock in the morning and i just decided to pack up and and and leave  uh without letting anyone know that i was leaving that was like one of the hardest decisions i've had to make

what's your dream job;my dream job um <sigh > gosh um writing um i've done a few um uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing um <tisk> but writing and teaching and traveling if i could do that overseas
yeah;so
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;outgoing should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it keeps going <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse
yeah;okay i'm sorry yes i i turned off my phone but i didn't turn off the the alarm is like <laughter> it's like i forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class i'm terribly sorry about that <laughter> okay <laughter> <laughter> sorry for the interruption
okay;um i have a actual fish tank um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing um i also try and meditate um i try and and just sit down and be quiet um and gather my thoughts um i like to read and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk
how are you at controlling your temper;<sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts every once in a while um when things are getting too chaotic at my house um and i'm feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger
has that gotten you in trouble;yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of um recognizing that i'm upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room
how do you cope with them;hmm i'm sorry
how do you cope with them;um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner
how hard is that;um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling
mhm;why i'm being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting i've had a very tense day um and things haven't gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there
(laughter;um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasn't married um <tisk> i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but we'd only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well um i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together
aw;um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision
that's good;to marry my husband and raise our child <laughter>
yeah;um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license uh which i'm very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical fifteen year old
(laughter;and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis
nice;no i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills
yeah;that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and it's like i i'm just not that person so i i i try and be i'm i i think i am a very good mother but i'm not um a typical mother i think i'm more um i'm more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing
mhm;actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most
i understand;i'm a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading i'll read 'til midnight um and then i'll try and go to sleep um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep
how have you been feeling lately;yesterday i didn't feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden
yeah;and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy
that's good;so no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy
that's great;<laughter> i don't know um i think she believes that i'm uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic
uh huh;um or empathetic and uh i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver
okay;i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i i'm working on that i'm trying to get those done
okay;oh gosh <laughter> um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career
yeah;um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well
mhm;um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it um so that's that was one of my prouder experiences
that's so good to hear;okay thank you

tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal
mhm;it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier
that's so good to hear;well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay
wow;it was
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;uh my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better

that's good;my girlfriend she's a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person
can you tell me about that;she since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zen-like man so what she's asking for is something that's gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate

how would your best friend describe you;uh probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing i'd ever done so that and i would don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that
i see;as it's my goal
is there anything you regret;no nothing i regret i felt
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;hmm ten or twenty years ago i don't know
okay;um <sigh> well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed uh i don't know how to put one above the other
okay;when things don't go my way and finances xxx come down and i don't get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting my fair chance at opportunity it's very frustrating
it can be tough to find a good job these days;i don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be i feel guilty about that i don't ever wanna be short with my girlfriend ever she wouldn't doesn't deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting or something so i don't wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty

i see what you mean;um i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to um travel um at least once once or twice every two years
what do you enjoy about traveling;um just exploring different things and being able to um have different experiences um things of that nature and you know learning new things and um just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel um you get a sense of um you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun
cool;um well from that trip i would say um swimming in the beautiful beautiful beautiful um miami beach waters was wonderful
that sounds like a great situation;yeah it was
what did you study at school;um child development
that sounds interesting;mhm
how did you decide to do that;well um i've always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh that's when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history
are you still working in that;i am yes it's been um fifteen years in august
wow;yeah
what's your dream job;my dream job i would say um to become a principal
why;well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses um so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you
that's great;um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do
i understand;um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say
okay;<laughter> uh i meditate i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time
uh huh;oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot
mhm;oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so yeah that was it
how did you feel in that moment;i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time
yeah;uh <sigh> a situation which i wish i would've handled differently honestly i haven't had a situation like that in in years i've pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli i've kinda got that down
okay;the hardest decision i've ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make
how do you cope with them;um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom
aw;i do yeah
do you find it easy to be a parent;um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;oh wow so many ways um the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i don't like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because that's kind of um the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so
yeah;i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite
that makes sense;thank you
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;um <sigh> well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies
how have you been feeling lately;i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i i've been feeling really good
okay;no i haven't
have you been diagnosed with depression;no i have not
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up i'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage carpe diem seize the day so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed every day
that's great;thank you
how would your best friend describe you;um as um nurturing patient loving friendly um kind of reserved
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert
is there anything you regret;you know what no regrets no regrets um you live and learn um nothing is perfect um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today
mhm;oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um to stay focused and to get a great education
what are you most proud of in your life;i'm most proud of um where i've come from um as a teenage mother um being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um i really um applaud myself for that
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome you were wonderful thank you
goodbye;buh bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah that's perfectly fine

what are some things you don't really like about l_a;uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks
yeah;uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young
wow;hmm <laughter>
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh we left um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza
(laughter;it was it was delicious <laughter>
nice;yep <laughter>
what did you study at school;scrubbed_entry graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer
what made you decide to do that;actually it's like what i don't know it's like you gotta have a plan and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me
what's your dream job;hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter>
(laughter;yeah but uh probably
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken
that's great;uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights
how are you at controlling your temper;i'm pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets
has that gotten you in trouble;uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's i don't i don't know
okay;probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um <sigh> hm <sigh> so many um i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted so it sucks but hey
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;that is an intriguing question <sigh> um i've actually no clue
okay;the death of my grandmother
can you tell me about that;sure um my grandmother died when i was eleven years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother and it was it was tough but um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears
that's good;uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem
what are you like when you don't sleep well;mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter>
how have you been feeling lately;uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work
can you tell me about that;uh sure um hm hm uh i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had three failure to appears in court which sucked tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so i don't know it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah
yeah;thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything
how hard is that;not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe
i see;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;hm really happy oh why is that such a difficult question uh mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day seems like
okay;uh dunking across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah
nice;mm i have four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each and i don't know studious hardworking determined mm i don't know
mhm;<laughter> yeah <laughter>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;hmm <sigh> i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh uh grade school i was uh i wasn't the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down
okay;uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential
what's one of your most memorable experiences;uh i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty
oh no;yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work
(laughter;but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah
that sounds like a great situation;about that day or in general
whatever comes to your mind;mm other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time i regret that
uh huh;yeah
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;hm i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself uh <sigh> i i have no clue that's that's an interesting question
okay;uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes it's it's pretty in
that's great;yeah
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;no problem
goodbye;<sync>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;doing pretty good
that's good;oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a californian <laughter>
cool;uh i'm a welder
how did you decide to do that;um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession
that's great;<sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that
i understand;well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better
that's good;it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing
mhm;<laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it
awesome;<sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child
has that gotten you in trouble;oh yes <laughter>
can you tell me about that;uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices
yeah;uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me
yeah;um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble
uh huh;hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly
okay;my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes
that's so good to hear;mhm
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me
hmm;<sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better
how do you cope with them;i'm sorry
how do you cope with them;i'm not understanding you i'm sorry
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;how <h no no i have not
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;two thousand one
what got you to seek help;um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that
do you still go to therapy now;uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me
okay;<sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so
that makes sense;well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby
(laughter;and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it
mm;well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh>
okay;<sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter>
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made
what are you most proud of in your life;my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter>
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;well thank you
goodbye;bye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;okay yes i am
okay;i'm good thank you
that's good;<laughter>
where are you from originally;originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america
really;yes
what are some things you really like about l_a;the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to
mhm;traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um um that's about it
i see what you mean;<laughter> when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean
nice;the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter>
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way
that makes sense;experiences on vacation or
yeah;um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter>
(laughter;business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field
what's your dream job;my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job
yeah;i'm outgoing
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> <laughter> that's cool <laughter> uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first
mhm;i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings
how did you feel in that moment;when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard
mm;hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense
uh huh;woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect
that's good;seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me
yeah;it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about
what made you decide to do that;uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return
okay;<laughter>
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day
that's good;really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not
okay;<laughter>
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no i haven't thank god
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;really happy let's see uh it's at home and i think it was when wow <mumbling> different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me
aw;<laughter>
that's so good to hear;thank you
how would your best friend describe you;um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with b s <laughter>
mhm;hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody
uh huh;i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys
i understand;hmm be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to revamp <re> don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments
what are you most proud of in your life;my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary scrubbed_entry and i'm always just true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from
yeah;<laughter> cool

do you feel like therapy is useful;therapy absolutely i love therapy
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;wow that's huge um confidence in self uh confidence in myself um confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of overall content uh a sounding board you know when i have stuff that's bothering me that i can't go to the i i feel that i can't go to the person with
yeah;i um can go to my therapist and a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn't a big issue or i worked through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation
mhm;and in that way i find therapy to be invaluable actually
that's great;i believe so uh yes i was
how long ago were you diagnosed;i believe it was i think it was told to me by a psychiatrist that that's what i was that's what i was having and this was within the last five years i think it was looking back now what are we two thousand thirteen it was two thousand nine so four years ago
what were your symptoms;not able to deal like shell shocked not able to deal with anything eh irritable on the phone uh i mean just uh just anything would get me to fly off the handle and um just uh not able just shell shocked and not and hiding at my in my house not opening mail <m> mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with with things that were that i felt were well that were bombarding me i felt overcomed <o> overcomed and um the psychiatrist said that it was post-traumatic stress disorder but um and i was given some medication which i stayed on for a year or so uh or so and i don't know through psychiatry and therapist and medication um i was able to come out of my shell a little bit
okay;hmm about a week ago i was on a hike eh up in malibu and uh at this beautiful labyrinth that looked over the pacific ocean and we i was with a friend and we were having lunch and i laid down on the grass and took a nap and i felt content i was happy at that moment at that moment that time about a week ago

mhm;um <sigh> good question i'd have to think about that
okay;uh yeah i have regrets in life you know everything works out so um you know if i could change the past i would've never dropped out of school when i did a long time ago i mean i've since gone back and completed lots of stuff um i probably would've gone into the military i think i was going to do that in my early twenties i'm fifty five now um i sort of regret not doing that um at that time um i regret uh selling my business i regret and of course i can't control this but i regret that my father died when i was so young and he never really got to know me and i never really got to know him i regret uh i regret not seeing my grandmother enough before she'd passed away i regret uh i mean those are the things that i can think of right now not putting away for retirement i regret when i had the money to do it um yeah i mean just here that's what i would say
yeah;stick with it just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and i it when it comes to fear or flight i get the fear and i flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then everything works out
mm;wow i'm most proud that i <sigh> have remained genuine um i'm most proud of being who i am and being basically comfortable with that and i'm proud of that i haven't changed to the world <wor> to the world you know for the world i haven't changed i've stayed mm who i am

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;very well
that's good;uh ohio
really;mhm
when did you move to l_a;uh finished school and came out to start my life
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh not often now not really often
why;uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home prior
i see;uh there's really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment
mhm;i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here
that's good;uh i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here
uh huh;uh i tend to not have things that i don't like uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like
that's so good to hear;yes i do
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between uh all types of people it's a very rich experience
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um which one to where
whatever comes to your mind;uh i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that
what's one of your most memorable experiences;there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and let's see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too
nice;wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um entertainment i've studied communications i've studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman
(laughter;<laughter> <laughter>
how did you decide to do that;ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and um just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that
i see what you mean;mhm
what's your dream job;um i don't have a dream job per se what i do have is a um desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so
mm;uh probably more outgoing mhm
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;<laughter> well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform before i move uh around i get exercise so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving and uh then move forward from there
that's great;uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;argued um cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument um don't know what it's about i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money
okay;situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is
mhm;mhm
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;hardest decision i've ever had to make um don't really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made
okay;mm event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase
i understand;uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out
that's good;uh great uh a little more uh physical exertion than normal  but uh still great <laughter>
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty even tempered
mhm;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;mm no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;uh that's pretty much every day <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it
how would your best friend describe you;uh very smart uh very loving uh very intelligent funny uh outgoing that's probably probably what my friends would say
uh huh;uh there's really nothing that i think i need <laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself like i'm okay with everything the way it is really am <laughter>
okay;what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago to know um to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up
mhm;recently really enjoyed uh uh cooked a very wonderful meal um 'cause i love cooking so that was something i really enjoyed
cool;mhm
what are you most proud of in your life;wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that i've learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the god within me
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm well thank you
that's good;uh boston massachusetts
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh quite often at least a couple times a year
how does it compare to l_a;um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love
why did you move to l_a;uh to pursue acting and writing
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality
mhm;<sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is
yeah;what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here
i see what you mean;mhm
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here
cool;oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;<clears throat> um one of my trips mm god well i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one
awesome;uh in general just
yeah;<clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental
how did you feel in that moment;i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever
that sounds like a great situation;mhm
what did you study at school;studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor
what made you decide to do that;writing to pursue writing
what's your dream job;writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first
how hard is that;hard very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to
mm;i would say outgoing on in general
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place
how are you at controlling your temper;i am getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm good at controlling my temper 'cause i don't usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it
has that gotten you in trouble;yes
can you tell me about that;no <laughter> hmm mm
okay;argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasn't it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly
okay;<sigh> hmm mm i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it
could you have done anything to avoid it;mm i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've made the outcome much less chaotic
i see what you mean;hmm uh i guess that would be hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always gonna feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good
yeah;yes
how did you decide to do that;i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just yeah
i understand;mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that
okay;my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family they're the ideal
that's so good to hear;my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy
what are you like when you don't sleep well;<sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off
how have you been feeling lately;i've been feeling pretty good lately
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;mm not really just trying to be more focused <clears throat> get things done
can you tell me about that;um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really stop wasting time or you know just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life
that's good;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her
aw;probably as um  very funny humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just they know they know that i'm there if they need them always
uh huh;my drive being more driven and just getting things done
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;mm i guess it would be well a recent a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible
i see;yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;don't second-guess yourself
what would you say are some of your best qualities;<sigh> <clears throat> um great listener constant sense of humor uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all just people from just all ages race gender whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i i'm people person and i um i start every day with a blank slate
mhm;i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring
nice;probably coming out to l_a on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;thank you
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;spectacular this is an interesting experiment
that's good;<laughter>
where are you from originally;uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa
really;<sigh> uh may second of two thousand seven so exactly five years six years ago
how often do you go back to your hometown;um infrequently like once every couple years
okay;uh the weather exists so it's more extreme and then  it's rather less exciting a lot less colorful
why did you move to l_a;uh winter in minnesota <laughter>
(laughter;uh it took approximately the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh the lights took care of the rest
wow;uh i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;oh you know the traffic <sigh> the exceedingly high cost of living uh yeah those are those are my big beefs
i see what you mean;uh not nearly as much as i would like to i've done a little bit
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh i like not knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to uh deal with people to deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh last year i got to hang out in san marcos for a little bit after i split up with my ex and then after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles
aw;<laughter>
what's one of your most memorable experiences;uh last week managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia scrubbed_entry as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like national news and he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else
(laughter;<laughter>
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles
can you tell me about that;um <clears throat> once i found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck
that's great;um if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out i i do all sorts of stuff it um usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project
cool;uh what temper <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;uh scrubbed_entry
how did you feel in that moment;um <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed
that sounds really hard;uh hard on him i mostly uh mostly got by with a couple of scrapes on my ego
okay;uh when  when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my <sigh> verbal gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was not my most graceful moment
uh oh;uh i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else
why;'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy
(laughter;i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was uh made a lot of hard decisions i guess <sigh> it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so it's a tricky question madam
what made you decide to do that;uh oh you know broken collarbone severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time
i see;<laughter> mm no my memories are important i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe
i understand;<laughter>
tell me about your relationship with your family;uh my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me uh my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy uh but since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce
that's good;uh jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately she is a magical creature
can you tell me about that;uh well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful there's the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is a hundred percent kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return i don't know that's <sigh> smitten <laughter>
how do you know them;uh <laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know uh i know her through my bicycle friends <sigh>
cool;uh the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits so i i get to sleep poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter
what are you like when you don't sleep well;<deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life
okay;uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire
why;um mm because the universe in its infinite uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor uh has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the arthur c clark sense uh so as a fortunate and <cough> vaguely aware being eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh yeah uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set
okay;mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no
have you been diagnosed with depression;uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago
can you tell me about that;uh i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um twenty thirteen <laughter> uh <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh an art project that all my friends helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling
awesome;<laughter> <sigh> that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though
what would you say are some of your best qualities;um i guess i'm enthusiastic i am thesauric and i am <sigh> i'm gonna have to say highly analytical <laughter>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;uh it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool
like what;uh like turning on some of the fancier finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself <laughter>
what are you most proud of in your life;uh that's a really tough one i think the thing that i'm most proud of would probably be <sigh> you know i'm not actually sure <laughter>
is there anything you regret;oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;<clears throat> <deep breath> don't masturbate so much <laughter>
(laughter;uh jackrabbit really bad puns uh and dessert
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;<laughter>

has that gotten you in trouble;not yet <sigh>

how did you feel in that moment;sad
i'm sorry;it's okay
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um i wish i could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year
why;uh i just didn't like high school or my sophomore year i
okay;uh getting sober and going uh into to a drug rehab
can you tell me about that;um when i was sixteen i got um <sigh> i just started doing a a few different drugs and it got out of hand i guess and my mom was trying to get me help and i didn't want the help so i kept uh escaping to different places and running away and not wanting to be in the places so i finally agreed to go to utah and try and get sober

do you feel like therapy is useful;it can be if the person's willing to change and wanting it
i see what you mean;two days ago

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah
okay;i'm okay
that's good;uh i'm from los angeles
really;mhm
what are some things you really like about l_a;oh um the weather <laughter> the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid backness the driving instead of public transportation
mhm;and the sporty
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;um i really i don't know the lack of um uh uh mm i don't know there's not a lot i don't like about l_a as compared to most cities i really it's my favorite and i've lived around the world i love it i love l_a a lot
that's great;<laughter> yes i've lived in paris and i've been around the world a lot
awesome;um uh it's just um it's fun and it's it's it's it's it's it's a blast it's good to see new places it's good to get to um get to experience all the fantastic um sights and and <ss> and cultures
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um uh well i mean um uh i i tended to actually do a lot of them um i probably would do them differently i think i'm more developed as a person now i i um i lived in paris for two years so and i lived in spain for spain was fun spain it madrid is a party town and then um and then so these were all work they were all work so i was working so it was um there's a grind there you didn't really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then i mean i still um i still i love going just to you know vacation spots like hawaii and and jamaica i'm still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff
yeah;um i guess madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was um it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of uh people that had never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around i might he might've been lying um but it was just it was bitching africa was pretty much the best senegal and madagascar yeah
nice;um i'm right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then i did a little bit of paralegal but that was really just to just to get the um just to get the stipend i didn't really have any concept of what i wanna do now i really do
what made you decide to do that;i have i was saying to rachel actually i don't know if you guys were able to overhear i really think that um the way the school system goes right now it um it just it it turns people into into um just um just uh dog eat dog um you know i i don't like the way the people <peo> it i think it's so draining the um school system right now and i feel pretty bad for everybody so i wanna try to fix that
yeah;that would be my dream job that so i'm excited that like i wanna go in a direction that i wanna go in and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting um kids on a more um organic universal um you know uh trajectory
how hard is that;um i think it could be done i don't think it would be done via any sort of um legislation except here and there i mean it it that always ends up for becoming you know facade and farce itself anyway but i think there are ways i've always reached kids anyway and they've always felt where i was coming from and so i think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system
okay;uh i guess i'm just a combination of the two i don't think um i don't know actually i'm kinda i might even be working that out there might some outgoingness to overcompensate for what's actually shyness and vice versa so you don't know
(laughter;<laughter> yeah
that makes sense;yeah
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;yeah that's cool um i definitely um uh try to reflect and stay in a pretty lucid space as often as possible so a lot of lying down at the moment i'm in transition so there's just a lot of and i and i hang out with my dogs a lot so that's quite soothing i try not to do i don't really do anything that's too tense unless it's time for it like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise um i try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it's not like break and but you know and i i miss <mi> i miss swimming i can't believe summer's coming so i'm gonna swim some more too
mhm;um when i'm truly outraged uh it comes out and then i i'm i'm i'm hitting some kind of bad parts right now 'cause it's a very hard time i'm fighting for my child so there are times when i will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam
has that gotten you in trouble;a little bit but usually pretty much there's always um you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it's like that bumper sticker if you're not outraged you're not paying attention so usually some kind of sanity can prevail
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh well i mean these are times where i just can't find somthing in the car and but when i argue with people it's been a lot of the times when i'm being flat out you know um sabotaged or or definitely just when uh what's the last specific time well i you know i lost my temper dreadfully with um unfortunately um the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic in a lot of i mean she's pretty much a horrible person so i i recently lost my temper with her
how did you feel in that moment;i felt like um i mean i like again um i think i sort of said this just now i felt in a way good because i get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but i guess there's another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it's like you know you get to a point where you're glad you can actually see that there's a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with the horrible travesty but so i mean i don't <do> i didn't feel like shame i really honestly didn't feel shame i didn't i didn't feel
i understand;there are times when i feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that's all but i never really feel bad for
yeah;being angry about what i'm angry about
okay;well when i was pregnant i wish i had um like i said um i i went through um such an awakening about realizing when i was being sort of um undermined that um that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when i was pregnant i ended up being so disrespected in the place 'cause i was being a hippie on the beach for six years so i always felt like i was being so disrespected in the place where um i was set to be when the child arrived that i stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan into the fire and they got my kid so
wow;yeah
that sounds really hard;it's fucked up yeah
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;i don't want to erase anything from my memory i like having everything consolidated and cohesive i don't and integrated i don't wanna erase anything from my memory
okay;um well did i get it right or did i get it wrong <laughter> um yeah i'm uh i guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign um sign mediation agreement with d_c_f_s and i should've said no let's just go straight to court because the there is nothing wrong with me i just happen to succumb to an s_s_i check via bullshit with my mother and i should've just been you know um brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead i chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out
what made you decide to do that;overcautiousness
okay;it's horrific horrendous bourgeoise quality intrigue and sabotage it's bad
i'm sorry;it's okay
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;someone that i mean there's been um you know there's been some some great people uh again from afar i have not sort of really um achieved a real great ability to build relationships and i'm working through that right right right <r> right now and i think that's a lot why i don't have my son but as i've grown and developed i've seen encouragement from like minded souls and you can see that and so that's wonderful and um but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that's really good for me it has been hard for me to um get to that point
okay;not so easy these days at all
why;um i'm being i've been um i'm not completely centered and then there's been some um actual you know uh people thinking it's funny to harass me or jolt me as they walk by and so there's been actual harassment and stuff like that
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um i'm still pretty pollyanna'd out i still forge ahead and try to be as pleasant as possible
how have you been feeling lately;i'm tired and drained and a little bit um frustrated because that i know that um i've been sort of that i sort of have a bit of um my um energy and and space being usurped <u> usurped and i can tell and i don't know how to get through that and past it
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um there are i'm i'm i'm basically very very very happy pretty much blissed out person but um this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it's as if the same trees that were thrown in my road in childhood before i realized i was such a happy person are thrown there again so i'm going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know um during the day i'll i'll i'll i'll think something completely true and organic and i i'll just stare at something and go wow that's beautiful and i'll be reminded that i'm pretty close to my spirit so um i try to stay there twenty four seven i'm pretty spiritual that way
how would your best friend describe you;um uh uh fun i mean if i had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there um that you know that i'm this is off you guys that i'm funny and that um and that um i think that's bad um that i'm funny and that i'm good and that that i'm trustworthy
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um just uh i'm i'm i not necessarily change but grow through um my ability to connect with the people i wanna connect with and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me
i see;i already said i regret the thing with um leaving the place where i could've delivered my son even though i was being um uh sort of abused
right;get the fuck away from your mother <laughter> sorry um you know and like a lot of the <th> um and and yeah and to open your eyes look what look what's going on
okay;i'm proud of my um spirit and my outlook and my um my access to um what's really going on in the world and my um awakeness i'm just proud of me as a person
that's great;okay
thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;you're welcome

mhm;um the traffic <laughter>
i see what you mean;um i've traveled but not too much
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh going away from your usual days um exploring new sights
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um three weeks no a month ago i went to las vegas uh with <wit> me and my friends and we just went sightseeing
nice;um in las vegas we went to the hoover dam and um it was breathtaking um the it was really big and we saw the the big canyon and it was impressive i've never seen something like that before
that's great;i studied nursing
are you still working in that;uh i graduated two months ago so i took my uh board exam to be licensed and i passed so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail
that's so good to hear;my dream job is to be a registered nurse
what made you decide to do that;um long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured and my parent had to take me to the hospital and um the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue it the medical field
wow;uh yes i am very happy
that's good;uh my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's it it's in between <laughter>
how close are you to your family;uh i am close i am very close to them um mm if i have a problem i i go to them for help
okay;um someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school
that's a long time;yes
can you tell me about that;yes uh we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've uh we've gone to elementary middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of <o> of mine
aw;i am shy
why;um i really don't know i've i've always been a quiet person um ever since i can remember
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;hmm what do i do i i go into my room i turn my a_c on and i just relax in my bed <laughter>
how are you at controlling your temper;i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes
that's good;the last time i argued with someone was about um work
how did you feel in that moment;i was disappointed um not angry just disappointed
why;because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what i usually can handle and he already knew that um my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad
yeah;mm i cannot remember one
okay;the hardest decision i ever had to make was dropping out of school
how did you decide to do that;um i felt that i didn't really belong uh far away from home and so i was just thinking ahead um i was in a major that i didn't really like and so i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to l_a
are you happy you did that;um right now that i'm looking at it yes i i am very happy that i did that because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now
that makes sense;hmm i don't have an event
okay;um it depends on the days um where i work or where i don't work
can you tell me about that;yes right now i i work at um at a retail store early in the morning i i go at three in the morning and i get out at ten a_m so it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep
wow;when i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy uh irritated or just frustrated with the situation
i understand;lately i've been okay <o> okay i've been good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;uh no i have not
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;hmm the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse

what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside
why;um i i'm a little <l> i'm overweight and i would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside
okay;hmm i don't have one
okay;no i don't
what's something you feel guilty about;um this one time i <sigh> at my work uh it's a retail store i i kinda took some merchandise without buying it
what made you decide to do that;um it was a risk that i took but um since no one was around and the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home
okay;i don't know
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;yes last weekend i went to i i went yard saleing with my family and it was pretty fun and going out to different yard sales and finding uh random stuff
nice;um i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for two dollars and so i got it and now it's in my room and i sit on it <laughter>
that's great;i am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse um that i am a nurse um i'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and xxx and nursing homes
uh huh;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;mhm
okay;um i'm doing good what about you
that's good;mhm
where are you from originally;um l_a <l> los los angeles but i currently reside <res>reside in inglewood wait did i answer your question
cool;i don't know
yeah;okay
what are some things you really like about l_a;l_a um the murals the ocean what else the people my family's over here so that's the best part
that's great;what about you oh wait yeah <laughter>
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;um i would say the smog yeah the air it could be cleaner and
i see what you mean;yeah um that's pretty <pre> i mean there's good people and bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good
yeah;um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples and northern california so yes
nice;traveling like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body cleaner bloodflow the um people culture and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends
that makes sense;yeah um any time like right now or when
uh huh;okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go the the smaller the steps get so like people back then had uh smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the the the steps but once you get up there it's a nice view i yeah
awesome;uh general education but um mainly art yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes
what made you decide to do that;um well when i was a kid i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so i just pursued it so yeah
what's your dream job;my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art
(laughter;yeah um yeah pretty simple
how hard is that;um it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion um persistence and faith and will you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed
mm;mhm
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i consider myself to be shy in certain um time and places but i am also out outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like it's well balanced you know like i'm shy when it's i guess okay to be shy you know and i'm outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore it feels good like if that makes sense but yeah
i understand;<laughter> yeah to uh relax um either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter> so that helps and i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when i use the color blue because the color blue um relaxes me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down
cool;yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah
how are you at controlling your temper;my temper um well my thoughts my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah that's pretty much how my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so controlling my temper is just by training my thought
mm;um <sigh> the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no so that kinda frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace so
yeah;yeah
tell me about your relationship with your family;my family um it's pretty good um my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married and my brothers and sisters um we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's like a team
that's good;a situation i wish i could handle differently would be hmm that's a good question i mean can i get a scenerio
whatever comes to your mind;okay um a situation i could handle differently well see that's the thing like i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe how would i handle the situation would be just by uh failing um failing making mistakes because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after so that's the best way i could answer your question you know
okay;yeah
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;a positive influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean they're actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah
mm;mm well see that's the thing like you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like scar me it did prepare me for like the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like you know like guns knives and all that stuff so
wow;it's it's bad but it's good in the long term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know and
yeah;so yeah
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;the hardest um man this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it
(laughter;but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing
yeah;life changing whether to continue school college or not mm i kinda chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so yeah
are you happy you did that;yeah yeah
that's good;um it's actually really easy i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down
wow;like like slow down my air pattern
(laughter;yeah mhm
how have you been feeling lately;lately i've been feeling good i've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air just trying to make my own i don't know that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will so yeah
that's great;lately like in the past two weeks or today
whatever comes to your mind;<laughter> okay uh yeah you know like um yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and for example right now it just happened
like what;huh for right now like
like what;this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this this whole experience yeah
okay;uh post traumatic stress disorder no
have you been diagnosed with depression;depression i know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no
can you tell me about that;uh depression how how it feels
mhm;how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in a cage being depression is like being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings um pretty much it feels like you're limited but then the thing is to get out of that depression it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like i i would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah
when was the last time that happened;um being depressed mm let's see mm i don't know like it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses so like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed but then what happened i fixed it like called up a friend and met up with him and yeah
that's good;um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool and yeah right now i feel happy
awesome;<laughter>
how would your best friend describe you;um sometimes hard headed like he would try to teach me um a certain lesson whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he would probably just describe me as like like like he would listen but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do so pretty much like i don't know yeah i mean that's what he tells me but yeah overall good person
mm;um probably just exercise um my diet food my food intake and yeah just exercise pretty much it
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;my health mm i would say when i was like in middle school or in elementary a little bit of high school too but what it would
can you tell me about that;yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art <laughter> like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like like trash and then i'd be like oh damn either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kinda dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah usually it's um people's words and ideas that
i understand;yeah yeah so that's it
is there anything you regret;regret um yeah i got a couple things i regret
like what;like what well sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone so yeah that's kind of a regret in my head
yeah;ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual well being you know learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself um pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment uh certain events you would experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah
uh huh;yeah among other things but yeah
what are you most proud of in your life;what i'm most proud of right now is my paintings yeah i'm proud of that because like i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know it's has own signature so so yeah i'm i'm pretty happy about that

wow;i got angry
that sounds really hard;it was cool it was fun life
(laughter;you know
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;huh i made <gibberish> maybe that maybe that situation could've been handled differently it could've been handled differently if they would've been handling things differently then i wouldn't have to react it's not like i was mad i was acting off of reaction i had to react like that because like justice like i couldn't it was unjust it was like i'm not a mean person at all but when i saw one of my loved ones get attacked i had to like come and like you know like react to that and they were the hot
i see what you mean;you know what i mean i was like yo ya niggas is tripping like yo chill out this is a tiny little white dude you're a humongous ass mexican nigga it's like you need to fall back you know what i mean it was crazy
yeah;<laughter>
what's something you feel guilty about;guilty uh i don't know i steal shit sometime from stores when i'm hungry if i got no money i guess i'm not really guilty 'cause i don't know actually yeah i don't feel guilty about that food should be free know what i mean but um yeah i don't know i lie i guess i lie <l> everybody lies sometime i lie sometimes maybe like little like idle here and there exaggerations
mm;okay <ok>
has that gotten you in trouble;nah nah never
that's good;the hardest
mhm;i guess i don't really know what the hardest decision was but i get faced with hard decisions and those would be like i got so many friends sometimes i can't really hang out with everybody in one weekend so it's like i gotta make decisions like if i go over this sector of the town i'm gonna hang out with x y z niggas if i go over here x y z niggas so it's like heavy you know those are hard decisions 'cause i never like to let anybody down so uh yeah stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with

aw;and it's tight i don't know
okay;something i could erase from my memory i wouldn't wanna erase anything from my memory 'cause that'll be like
why;because like the experiences you go through make you who you're who you are i think weak people like to wanna erase things or block things out like i don't that doesn't exist i mean there's shit that's been hard but i would never say i would not want that to happen 'cause you know you must you gotta learn from experience you know i mean to be the better you all that shit is like a is like test you know that bad experience is just a test you gotta overcome and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my god life's hard oh you know that shit's for weak people
uh huh;i don't believe in that i have compassion for people who do get a who do wanna do stuff like that but i still like i don't see the logic in it
mm;mm
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;i mean i stay up pretty late and do all sorts of reckless ass shit so uh but when i am home and it's pretty easy i could just go to sleep you know when i get tired i get tired yeah

that sounds like a great situation;oh yeah it was
do you feel down;no i didn't even have a crazy comedown i'm i'm like i'm chilling i definitely gained a couple pounds from last week i've been drinking a lot of beers i'm feeling a little extraneous but besides that i'm i'm ready
okay;hmm okay
how would your best friend describe you;i don't know as a lovable dude people be loving me man they don't like me they love me and that shit's crazy i just you know i just try to be happy i try to make people happy and just you know <sniffle> be real posi-core as they've said like this is hella positive <p> positive you know
mhm;man i really don't wish i could i mean i'd lose weight i guess that's about it but besides that i that's i mean i ride bikes every day like my legs are pretty strong maybe i'd just get more buff in the arm but that's about the only thing i would change and i don't really <r> i'm not really in a hurry to change that like if that happens just through me living and me biking more then yeah cool but i don't not <n> i'm not you know abrupt change i don't need i mean gradual change sure but i'm not i don't know yeah i wouldn't change anything but if i would it would be that but really nothing 'cause i'm chilling right now
mm;uh i don't know i got broken up with like in august that made me feel bad about myself i guess and yeah it was just somebody i was going out with but they just broke up with me and like that shit sucked but that was probably the last time like i felt really bad about myself <cough>
can you tell me about that;um what exactly do you wanna know about that
whatever comes to your mind;oh like um i don't know we were just going out and then she was just hella jealous and was going through my phone sometimes and accusing me of shit but then she ended up breaking up with me just 'cause she wanted to like mess around with other people and that was the relationship in a nutshell
that sucks;uh life sucks you gotta adapt and change man know what i mean
yeah;don't walk from it run to what'd you say
is there anything you regret;yeah that bitch gave me s_t_ds that shit sucks fucking a that's the only thing i regret
i'm sorry to hear that;yeah man it's a cold game but i i got the shot it was cool i'm like boom clean but that's about it i don't know she's a cool person we still hang out you know she keep losing i'm just gonna keep winning know what i mean don't run from it run to it know what i mean

(laughter;i don't know i wouldn't know i wouldn't wanna alter young me actually and this is why i say this because if i would to tell my young self to do something differently i would not have grown into the person i am right now to even be able to tell my young self something if if <i> if the laws of quantum physics and all that shit is real and time travel you know anything i do in the past would this life would be now be a variable so me going back there telling him to do something differently will alter the course of history and then the time stream that i'm in may not may cease to exist
right;you know what i'm saying so i really wouldn't wanna do that i'll just be like do fuck up fuck up more even but yeah make more mistakes 'cause the only way to to be a better person is to make hella mistakes you know at least that
i see what you mean;at least that's like my my reckless like mindstate like yo if you're gonna fuck up fuck up hard 'cause you'll learn more from it you know they say what do they say um experience is the best professor you know what i'm saying that's basically what that that's how i jive you know what i mean
yeah;<sniffle>
what are you most proud of in your life;i'm proud of this life that i'm here doing stuff like this <laughter> like i'm like so stoked i've been around the country i've been on people's albums i write i do voiceover works from time to time and yeah i people know me i rap i ride bikes i've infiltrated multiple subculturals i mean subcultures and types of people in the city scrubbed_entry and um yeah man i don't know i guess it's like i live my life like i'm running for mayor but i'm not really running for mayor i'm just running to be the best me i can be so i'm kissing hands and shaking babies along the way and it it's been a rad fantastic time and it could only get bigger and better

what are some things you don't really like about l_a;um i don't like the superficiality of people um the narcissistic attitude um uh just the um uh it it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where you know just the warmth the human sort of warmth interactively so
i see what you mean;yeah
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;no
why;um i have um a fear of flying and i have um i've developed agoraphobia
i'm sorry;<laughter>
how hard is that;uh incredibly difficult
can you tell me about that;um yeah i'm i'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia um more so than the fear of flying um
mhm;it's uh it's more of a recent um development and um it's um eh it's progressing <pregr> progressing um to be worse uh it's very um uh what's the word um immobilizing and and very um distressing actually
that sounds really hard;mhm <laughter> yes it is
how do you cope with them;how to i cope with that um just uh just trying to um uh do the best i can and uh try to you know have the most courage i can in the situation and challenge myself in um small steps um i read a lot i do um bibliotherapy reading um and i try to inform myself um of the um of the professional literature um so that i could um hopefully overcome it someday
that's good;mhm
are they triggered by something;um yes definitely
like what;um uh certain things trigger it like um enclosed spaces um being in a car traveling um uh being away from home um being in someone else's car uh things that are outside of my uh locus of control
okay;um uh xxx actually i i don't go to school right now
what's your dream job;um my dream job is to be a psychologist <laughter>
awesome;um i'm not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is um uh having lived um through some challenges like this um having lived through some traumas um but i've always had an interest in it um since junior high of um uh i'm very interested in people and um in human interaction and human connection and um the betterment of of uh of those things um bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their challenges <chall> uh personal uh challenges um uh so that's that's sort of um it in a nutshell
okay;um i think i'm someone who's um i can be very outgoing um and sort of um a warm and friendly presence very um easily but i think on <o> on on the exterior um but i think i'm shy and i challenge it to do that i think at heart i'm shy um but uh but i i challenge myself completely 'cause i do love human interaction so i take those risks and and jump and those challenges
okay;uh the last time i interacted with somebody was <laughter> today
can you tell me about that;if <i> if i think i'm understanding your question correctly
yeah;oh no no eh i think i'm misunderstanding your question but i i interacted with rachel um i just i'm um continuously interacting with people take taking those risks
okay;uh very good um mm very good <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um when was the last time i argued with somebody i actually can't remember it wasn't recent <laughter>
okay;i have to think about that i don't know yet let me think um uh i'm drawing a blank um i can only rememeber things um from when i was like twenty one <laughter> right now i can't think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is
whatever comes to your mind;okay uh when i was younger
can you tell me about that;yes um i lost um a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins um 'cause when i was twenty one i'm forty five um i um uh uh had a a disagreement with my aunt and um i said something that was uh critical of her and um she threw me out of their home and um uh let me back uh i apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives um and changed their minds um so i regret that
how did you feel in that moment;um i'm assuming you mean um how did i feel when they asked me to um never uh be in their lives again and to leave um uh shattered soul shattered heart shattered
yeah;well that that was my family that was um the the good side of my family there's um uh uh the majority of my family <fa> they were they were the the loving aspect of my family um the rest of my family is very cruel and um like very abusive
how close are you to your family;um i don't have any relationship with my family at all like the since i was um uh twenty one since my aunt and uncle um uh disowned me i guess is the right word estranged yeah
okay;um gosh um i'm drawing a blank just bear with me for one second um something i could um erase um <laughter> i can't even get it to my memory um uh as an example um uh i was injured and i wish i could get uh that away from my memory
can you tell me more about that;yeah um i was injured in um the emergency room scrubbed_entry doing um i went in for food poisoning um i was ordered to go in um by a doctor um i had collapsed and i was ordered to go into the e_r for as i said food poisoning and i came out um injured with a neurological syndrome i was injured with a um uh what do you call it um uh intraveneous procedure um and now i have um r_s_d reflex sympathetic dystrophy and it the scene in the emergency room was um it was a an out of control scene there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake um eh and it was extremely excruciating um it was a a crisis and so um every time i think about the injury and it was uh disfiguring i got disabled um for <f> i uh got disabled for it uh disabled permanently um from it i was also um uh disabled from my employment for a quite amount of quite a given amount of time as well
oh no;and and it i have residual um physical trauma from it and disfigurement and um severe disability <disabil> disability limited um um functionality uh with my right my i'm right-handed uh with my right hand and arm
i'm sorry to hear that;thank you
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;i don't even know what that is um i you know i i really i apologize 'cause i can't really probably give you the uh most suitable answer um uh i'm guessing it had something to do with um  my cat um and her um her xxx urgent uh um uh what do you call it um hurt she was in intensive care veterinary care and i'm sure it had something to do with that um but other than that i would say um i had uh choosing my life path whether scrubbed_entry um and uh i was admitted um to that program or whether i was gonna go um to um art school for four years um and i had to pick a life direction but uh that's not a traumatic situation um so i i don't know how best to answer your question
okay;i can't
why;um i have um severe nightmares <laughter> and i have um nocturnal um  uh panic attacks
are they triggered by something;and i also have physical illness on top of it and i'm in excruciating pain
do you have disturbing thoughts;yes
are they triggered by something;yes
can you tell me about that;yes uh they're triggered by the injury that i told you um they're triggered by my family um they've <th> how they've treated me what um they've said to me what they've done to me um they're triggered by um what else um my um my physical um illness um not my injury only but my physical um illness as well um so yes

have you been diagnosed with depression;uh yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;um three years ago and um when i was um twenty years old
what got you to seek help;um the my background my childhood um from my family of origin um and their um uh uh you know the abuse that i um went through uh and their ultimate um uh uh what's the word um rejection of me and uh estrangement um that was the first uh reason
do you still go to therapy now;um no i stopped six months ago
why did you stop;<sigh> um why did i stop um i'm just taking a break <laughter> i'm gonna continue
okay;yes very much
how has seeing a therapist affected you;it's helped tremendously
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um i think it helps with anxiety it helps with um um it helps inspire um create inspiration it helps um um uh feeling connected um it helps to create um what i ultimately um my goal is to um give myself a voice and um um uh it helps to to do <d> to uh it <i> it's part of that process um it also helps um to understand myself um to learn about myself um and eh there's just so many benefits it's i i'll stop right there there's many more
that's good;mhm
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um the last time i felt really happy it was a was a really long time ago um it was before my illness um and it was in nineteen ninety seven um the onset of my illness was in july of ninety seven so it was um before that <laughter>
can you tell me about that;yes um i was um in a very good place um in terms of my career um um in terms of um uh my just my relationships and um everything was just sort of at it's best um uh career relationships um personal um uh fulfillment um sort of um as well um i was very active and and doing uh very many things that were meaningful to um build a life um and i was um in the process of um uh just in the in <i> in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at at the same time so it was just things were just going very well and um i just really liked uh
okay;the just where my life was at it was just in a really good place in many ways
i see what you mean;mhm
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um i wish i could change about myself um my anxiety um i wish i could change about myself um my agoraphobia my p_t_s_d um meaning my trauma um and um uh what else um um my insecurity uh as far as um uh just um with <w> with other people in the sense that i'm always trying to make sure that um that i don't do something that that um hold on one second i'm just trying to make sure that um i don't do anything that's um offensive to them or insults them um or uh is disrespectful um and i i feel like i'm overly um cautious about that and um it it it kinda becomes um an anxiety unto itself um so i i definitely think that that would be beneficial uh to change um the other thing i'd like to change about myself is i wish i could feel um and also depression i'd like to change that about myself i wish i could feel better um i wish i didn't feel um uh so um uh i didn't wish i didn't have the burden that i do of um my family um of not having one um and uh what else um i wish i didn't have my illness and the physical um excruciating pain that i'm in uh so those are some things um
mhm;and i also wish that um and this is um a a by-product of p_t_s_d i wish that i didn't have um uh the the symptomology of p_t_s_d um 'cause that definitely um affects one's complete <com> complete the complete life like eh a lot their affects their life uh completely um and i i wish i was more articulate and i wish i was um someone who was well-spoken and someone who is well-written um but there's many there's many more um uh things that i wish i could change about myself to improve myself so many more
yeah;<sigh> um i'm not sure uh <sniffle> maybe to um not be so trusting um i trusted um i trusted some medical professionals that um you know again created the injury and um you know were there's a uh what's the word there's an expectation and a sort of a demand to just blindly trust um the medical profession um and <sniffle> um don't ask questions and just sort of um you know and if and not to trust your own self your own um your own instincts um or intuition um and so i would i would've told myself to be a little more careful um i guess if that's useful to your question
mhm;<sniffle>
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;um what did i really enjoy um you know i can't think of anything specific um but um i know it would have to do um with either reading or um connecting with someone on a meaningful level

what made you decide to do that;really a spur of the moment type of thing um wanted to try something different something i'd never done before and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try 'cause of a you know 'cause of a certain stigma that comes along with it
mhm;uh and you know i just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that
cool;yeah what in the uh uh mm urban farming or in general
yeah;in urban farming uh i don't know i guess uh i don't know just just the overall experience just going you know eating uh going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just seeing the difference in you know how fresh natural food taste eh you know as opposed to the food you buy in a grocery store

can you tell me about that;well i don't know i've been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time and <sigh> i guess the hardest part of the decision was thinking whether whether or not i would be secure or not you know what i mean um
yeah;just going to a new place where you don't know anyone uh it's kinda uh you really don't know what's gonna happen so uh there was a lot of uh you know fear in that in that decision of should i go to a place where i don't know anyone i don't i'm not familiar with the area you know only only perception ever had <ha> that i have of this area is you know what i've seen on in media media and t_v so you know eh yeah guess that was hardest hardest decision <deci> decision that i can think of

mm;very easy
that's good;uh maybe unsure i would say
why;because right now i really don't know what direction i wanna go in with my life and there's been a lot of confusion with that um but you know it's not it's not something that overly affects me but you know it's always a thought in the back of my mind it feels <feel> feels like somehow maybe i'm running out of time and i know that's not like that's not xxx that's not a realistic thought because i don't see how you could ever run out of time but yeah i guess yeah just general not knowing what i want but i know like

mhm;how do i cope with that i uh i don't know i just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul searching
how hard is that;it's not hard i mean i mean i'm it's xxx like i can't say it's hard because it's one of those things that i feel like it's necessary and you know certain things in life you just you're forced to face so

hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes i'm okay with this
okay;i'm pretty good feeling a little tired but uh feeling pretty good for the most part
that's good;um redondo beach
really;yep
what are some things you really like about l_a;i like the beach i like the mountains i love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day um i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact
cool;i don't like the traffic i don't like the congestion of people here and i don't like the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas
i see what you mean;uh i've been trying to actually um last year was the summer of really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and been to various states here and there trying to get out there
what do you enjoy about traveling;i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing> different foods that are native to that local area and it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know this planet we call earth
mm;um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just very lush beautiful trees the uh the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around
nice;yeah
what's one of your most memorable experiences;<deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences was probably the uh the trip we took to colorado last summer and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and see the the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do
that's so good to hear;yeah
what did you study at school;i uh i studied business management and uh economics right now
what made you decide to do that;um i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics
are you happy you did that;yeah i'm really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life
that's great;yeah
do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing;i consider myself more outgoing i'm i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff
why;<sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease
okay;from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea
(laughter;probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i would've just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now it's just awkward
that sucks;yeah it does
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;the hardest decision i've ever had to make man that's a toughy i don't think i've had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision
okay;i don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i couldn't think of anything
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part i know that's kinda weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy
that's great;yeah
tell me about your relationship with your family;uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm
mhm;my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them <th> them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life
that's so good to hear;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and wake up in the morning
what are you like when you don't sleep well;i'm tired sometimes i'm could sense that i'm a little drained and uh maybe get a little groggy here and there
uh huh;and that's it
how have you been feeling lately;feeling pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks and um for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while
awesome;yeah
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d
have you been diagnosed with depression;i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh>
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday
aw;and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and it's just seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her
that's great;yeah
how would your best friend describe you;probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there
uh huh;and uh gets a little outspoken sometimes
has that gotten you in trouble;no not really for the most part no not really
okay;just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and that's not i'm not going that way right now so
i understand;mhm
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;no biggie <sigh> oh man i couldn't can't really think of a time
okay;i went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh sequoia and just me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes it was a lot of fun that was
that's great;yeah
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya
is there anything you regret;um <sigh> sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um and that's pretty much it now
okay;i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want and uh i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years
mhm;for sure
goodbye;bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes

mhm;and the weather's great
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;the traffic um lately the change in weather it's kind of a little too unpredictable but it mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people
i see what you mean;uh i wouldn't say a lot just um occasionally
what do you enjoy about traveling;uh it's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe i wouldn't normally do different people um learning about different people different customs um depends i mean if it's a water real pretty water and xxx you know being in beautiful water um relaxing adventure i love adventure
yeah;uh <laughter> uh some time ago i went to cayman islands and um went on i get seasick but my sister gave me some medication and i went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and i accidentally got back on the wrong boat
really;um yeah and um they're really crazy they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat <laughter>
(laughter;and i thought i was gonna drown 'cause the water was kinda rough i was really shocked they they wanted me to do that
oh no;yeah but i survived <laughter>
that's good;yeah pretty good
what did you study at school;uh business management but also
how did you decide to do that;also hypnotherapy
cool;i didn't hear that other question
how did you decide to do that;um well i came from a serious kinda family so that just seems something that would be universal that would cover a lot of different subjects
are you happy you did that;yes yeah but um yes and no i mean now i kinda wish it was something different
like what;um i like communication i love speaking and interviewing strangers um i'm very outgoing um and funny so probably would've been something more like either liberal arts communication that type of thing
that makes sense;uh dream job would just be out there you know like some of these people maybe on t_v exploring different places and getting paid for it and eh always like a fun adventure uh interacting with people um doing things i haven't done before and um helping people you know on some way with what i do xxx that they can see you know that i'm uncoordinated and in some ways and you know they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too <laughter>
yeah;uh i watch t_v i go work out um i go walking i recently got like a a bike that i kinda sort of fixed up um go do something new go to a festival go grocery shopping interact with friends call them see them
uh huh;that type of thing talk to strangers
how are you at controlling your temper;um depends on the situation there's a bunch of times i'm good at it um if it has to do with like traffic and cars it's a little more intense for me it's a little tougher or people who are like really rude you know with the way they cut you off
has that gotten you in trouble;almost <laughter> um luckily not you know i'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot i'll i'll confront them on that sometimes
mm;um might've been with my sister um it had to do with um i'm not sure of the topic but um whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got in an argument it it sounds childish about who was right you know 'cause she thinks she's always the smarter one 'cause she's older
how did you feel in that moment;uh sometimes it's frustrating 'cause it's like it's a no win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody 'til you know they acknowledge that she's right um other times i just let it go and let her rattle on 'cause it's it's kinda nonproductive
yeah;uh i'm real close to i see my parents almost every weekend um more close to my mother um i have a twin sister i stay in touch with her even though she's out of town she lives out of town and i've got two other sisters so i stay in touch with all of 'em you know it's a mixed bag you know um we kinda have assertive aggressiveness in us a little bit
uh huh;<sigh> but also
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;um well me <laughter> um and um ever i mean strangers sometimes my family you know they've done nice things for me um strangers have been very um sometimes unexpectedly very nice
can you give me an example of that;uh i could be shopping and um you know i'm maybe i can't reach something and some guy'll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out um
aw;uh that type of thing or um if somebody's like kind of mean to me somebody'll like commiserate <laughter> you know and um xxx
yeah;um i had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me um 'cause he thought i didn't like his dog it was you know i'm not crazy about dogs but um he kinda flipped out for a year and a half and um just said very nasty things to me when other people weren't around um i wish i'd confronted that back then because i you know but it created a lot of anxiety for me 'cause i feel like i could've nipped it in the bud and to instead of having to deal with the um major stress from it now he and i don't talk at all i just feel it's best he's kind of odd
i see;hmm god there's been a lot um sometimes breaking up with somebody or um <sigh> yeah it's usually or getting rid of a friend that type of thing
okay;um sometimes i feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people um where maybe i wasn't as understanding um eh <sigh> when i was younger i stole things you know that's not the best behavior and um and it's stuff like that
uh huh;oh god there's a lot of 'em um i wish i could erase you know how um tough my dad was on us as children and um erase a lot of memories of men i dated that just didn't work out well at all and um yeah
okay;i can drop off like right away
that's good;yeah
what are you like when you don't sleep well;cranky <laughter> irritated um
(laughter;snarky <laughter>
how have you been feeling lately;um a bit out of sorts um i've had some anxiety uh with money um and relationships 'cause i haven't been in one for so long male <laughter> um just a lot of anxiety um mm yeah
how do you cope with them;<sigh> take a deep breath um try and do positive things you know sometimes um eat healthier work out more um talk to my friend about it
mhm;that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me <sniffle>
okay;well not officially but i know <sigh> you know from mm things i've experienced that i've had <ha> i've you know i get very anxious in certain situations
are they triggered by something;um yeah uh it's usually triggered by um sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me um if they're aggressive whether it be physically or verbally uh or sometimes if they're too much in my space <s> my uh space you know where i am it bothers me
mhm;um yeah a long time ago
how long ago were you diagnosed;it was ages ago maybe over ten years ago fifteen years ago
what got you to seek help;um i was depressed <laughter> i mean i <laughter> know that's nothing to laugh about but i mean it's kinda in a circle um just to um wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more
what were your symptoms;um feeling stuck in certain thoughts um having a lot of negative thoughts um feeling of hopelessness helplessness that type of thing
do you still go to therapy now;xxx um i go occasionally it's a different type um i'll go see a hypnotherapist um sometimes to release <rel> release <rel> release anxiety that's in me
do you feel like therapy is useful;yes i do very useful
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um a lot more awareness of myself and other people um learning more control more confidence um better self-esteem um willing to try even more things you know whether i know the outcome or not you know of the unknown i'll experiment a lot more
mhm;scrubbed_entry um helping like at the twenty fifth mile handing out water and there were some people there who were doing that for the first time also some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us and um i was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes i'm like really funny you know and i can't even believe myself you know i just go on and on you know and everyone starts laughing i'm not even trying to and i'm just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny and laugh <sniffle> yeah that
(laughter;um as a really decent loyal uh empathetic um deserving um supportive i'm hoping <laughter> um outgoing quirky type of person
uh huh;um well it'd be great to uh look even younger uh or be younger if that was humanly possible <laughter> um be even more patient with people i think um you know not get frustrated like if i think somebody's not very smart uh sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people
mm;whoa um <laughter> uh <sigh> wow make a lot of money and plan for your future um and try and be as kind and patient with people as possible and have a lot of fun try new things
mhm;i think of my mind and my perseverance that um i've changed a lot of things within my personality um uh i feel proud of volunteer work i xxx helped <hel> feel proud i've helped bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes um i've helped create a lot of positive change in people

why;um i only been like to texas las vegas and that's pretty much it
nice;mhm
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um catching a airplane to houston texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to las vegas a lot that's
can you tell me about that;oh yeah um well when i was younger i used to go visit my dad and 'cause he used to live in houston texas and i used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun i wasn't scared that was a lot of fun and i enjoyed that <laughter>
that sounds like a great situation;um when i went to school i studied child development and nursing
how did you decide to do that;um i know i wanted to be somebody and when i went to school i wasn't sure what i wanted to be so i kinda took um nursing the l_v_n program first and then i didn't wanna be a nurse so i changed my major to child development and i graduated from that
that's great;no i'm actually looking for work i'm unemployed right now
what's your dream job;my dream job would be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business
how hard is that;in my mind it's simple but like in reality it seem like it's kinda difficult <laughter>
yeah;sometimes i'm shy but i'm really an outgoing person and a people person
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;hmm <laughter> um to relax i listen to some slow music i kinda like um have a quiet environment and maybe lay down watch a little t_v or something
cool;i'm very good at controlling my temper i don't like to get really angry or upset or get to where i'm fitting to hurt somebody <laughter>
that's good;um when i really have arguments they're like because people don't agree to disagree and then it's over <o> like really petty it's like we might say oh it's just like my opinion and they don't agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it's like nothing really big or anything like that it's just stupid i don't even remember <laughter>
okay;um probably not working right now i need a job <laughter>
it can be tough to find a good job these days;yes
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um maybe <sigh> i don't really remember a situation i try to really think before i really handle a situation and i try to handle it in a my best positive way before i really do something i regret
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;um being with somebody like a guy you know if i wanna continue a relationship with them or just
mhm;be single
i see what you mean;mm
tell me about your relationship with your family;um my relationship with my family i don't have i just really stay with my dad and i have a daughter and we just stay close all my family they're either in um houston texas or they're around but i don't really socialize with a lot of my family
uh huh;my dad
why;because um i live with him right now i've been staying with him maybe about five <f> five to six years and he's just the only one i really look up to i don't really have nobody else around me to really look up to and that's it <laughter>
okay;scrubbed_entry she's in the fifth grade she's graduating she's going to the sixth grade and i'm kinda excited for that
aw;sometimes it's easy but uh sometimes it gets a little overwhelming
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;um the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent
what's the best thing about being a parent;it's just you always have somebody to bring you joy i enjoy always doing things with my daughter um it's just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always it's brings me so much joy being a parent
that's so good to hear;well um my parents when i was younger they lived apart so my mom i don't know i'm i'm a much better parent 'cause i'm more interested about what my child wants to do i'm involved in her life her every step just i'm really fully involved my parents wasn't really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just i had to mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids
that sounds really hard;so it was
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um just my parents and um their drug addiction i wish i could erase that from my memory
how do you cope with them;um now i cope with them well but um when i was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own um they wasn't involved in my decisions in life you know i just i didn't know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything it just was like i was in a world by myself
yeah;yeah
how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep;oh it's very easy i sleep well every night i can sleep any time i sleep very well
that's good;um a little sad but most of the time i'm very happy i'm just not happy with where i am in my life right now
i understand;um not really i really i try to think very positive and try to do whatever i can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused
uh huh;no i haven't
have you been diagnosed with depression;no i haven't
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um the last time i felt very happy was when i graduated from um college i felt very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time i was really really very happy like that
how did you feel in that moment;i felt like i was on top of the world i felt like just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day i was just very very happy nothing could make me upset that day i was very happy and when i think about that day it just it's a very happy experience for me
yeah;um right now i don't have <ha> really have a best friend i really try to i'm i tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn't really making a lot of positive choices so right now i'm just like um i really don't have any friends right now
i understand;um my personality um i'm a happy person i'm a outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother
mhm;um insecurities like um sometimes i feel like um i have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something i feel like i can't get through something i can't get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes
yeah;well i did have a friend and she was like bipolar and i tried to really be her friend no matter um the disease she had but she wasn't a really good friend because she one day she start just um being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn't really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely
yeah;yeah just being friends with certain people that don't have positive things going on with themselves or just don't it just when i notice things about people that should determine whether i wanna be their friend or not you know they might have
mm;bad qualities or just some bad habits they might smoke cigarettes or drink and i should notice that that's a red flag and i shouldn't be these people friends <laughter>
yeah;yeah
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;um to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track
okay;well i went um to a friend's house that i haven't seen since childhood and they it was just a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and i really enjoyed seeing my old friends that i didn't see in a long time and just being with my family and certain friends i really enjoyed because i'm really always in the house i really don't go out that often so just i enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time
awesome;yeah
what are you most proud of in your life;um i'm proud that i did get my g_e_d i did graduate and i do wanna be somebody and i'm very proud that i wanna be a better parent than my parents
that's great;thank you <laughter>
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing well thank you
that's good;from los <l> los angeles
really;mm sports outdoor sports mainly
like what;surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing
awesome;traffic
i see what you mean;yes
what do you enjoy about traveling;experiencing different cultures
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;uh well uh i love going to mexico and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but uh the uh the level of of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds
yeah;traveling you mean
yeah;uh i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place
nice;i studied biology
how did you decide to do that;uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also
are you still working in that;not at all i'm working in areas of business now
are you happy you did that;yes i am
what's your dream job;my dream job would be to be a missionary
really;yes
can you tell me about that;my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that
yeah;i exercise
okay;i think i'm pretty good at it uh uh i think i'm pretty effective at it
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her uh lack of consideration
how did you feel in that moment;um i felt frustrated
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;hmm a situation which i wished i could handle differently um i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that is so wrong and so in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that uh takes care of the anger immediately
has that gotten you in trouble;yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end uh it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble
that makes sense;uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued uh at length for many months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh uh difficult period in my life
i see;mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their uh betrayals uh but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today
mm;uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that um even though my father was somewhat of a uh hard-handed uh and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil
i'm sorry;uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and uh he's not working he's very highly educated and he uh well he doesn't talk to me and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family
that sounds really hard;yes
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest and kind uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers
i understand;eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago
how have you been feeling lately;um xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future about whether i will survive this or not
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;not really
do you feel down;no
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;never
have you been diagnosed with depression;never
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion
that's so good to hear;funny jovial uh uh intelligent a perfectionist
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um maybe uh is to submerge my uh hedonistic self
can you tell me about that;i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um uh deferrer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was whereas i am looking always for the present um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away
yeah;<deep breath> it would be my ex-boss and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continued to use more profanity until uh i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago
wow;mhm
is there anything you regret;anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids
could you have done anything to avoid it;sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not we do not have the highest uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree
right;mm that's a good one i would say <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far
tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed;i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me
that's great;<deep breath> i would say <sigh> my devotion to the environment uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um uh a steward of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;sure

are you still working in that;i am
what's your dream job;mm making a good living through my art
how hard is that;it's challenging
can you tell me about that;well i need <nee> it's about having the time and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision
mm;somewhere in between
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;i read i walk dogs i spend time with my family
okay;oh it's very good i i love my family very much and they love me very much we're very supportive of each other
that's so good to hear;i'm pretty good most of the time i'm not so great when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic but it's not out of control <laughter>
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;hmm i don't really remember i wanna say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid <laughter> some little stupid thing
(laughter;um my daughter is um thirty nine beautiful brilliant um very talented very uh uh goal driven my son is twenty seven he is more laid back sweet <s> very sweet um and he's starting to be a little more goal driven um a little less satisfied with just uh the daily grind
mhm;being a parent is um very challenging in a wonderful way
what's the hardest thing about being a parent;um i think the hardest thing is is eh fear and worry for your children um today's world can be very um violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being
yeah;i'm sorry
what's the best thing about being a parent;oh gosh um mm friendship <frien> eh the close friendship you have with your children the the uh uh love the support the joy of just everyday little things that you share
what are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents;oh <laughter> well i'm i i talk to my children about anything and everything um we're very <v> have a very open communication which in my parents' generation i think children were more seen and not heard
yeah;<deep breath> hmm <sigh> well with my daughter my first child i was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but and naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general and i think probably eh most parents mm have regrets uh of uh situations they may have had their children in when they were when they were young that weren't the best
okay;<deep breath> <sigh> sometimes i feel that i should've been more aware at a younger age
can you tell me about that;mm just xxx just mm decisions and situations that uh decisions you make situations you find yourself in when you're younger out of being naive and and um even though logically i know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time you know as you get older you eh hindsight is twenty twenty as you get older you you look back and wish that you had've been more on top of your your uh your life when you were younger
yeah;oh gosh i honestly can't think of anything
okay;hmm um i don't know that i would want i i can think of an event i don't know that i would wanna erase it from my memory because eh i feel that we learn from everything and there <the> there's i i don't wanna lose the lesson that i'm to learn from that experience
that makes sense;positive influence in my life uh my daughter my son my granddaughter um there's a a a oddly enough an author uh carlos castaneda
can you tell me about that;um just a a a positive <po> my my family's been a positive influence because of their love and support and uh in reading carlos castaneda's works i find that he has a brilliant mind and because i've practiced some of what he talks about in his books and experience them as being authentic um uh whereas some people you know question his validity i i found that he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind
okay;pretty easy <laughter> i fall asleep pretty quick
that's good;good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;<deep breath> mm no not really just always looking for the next uh um project to to uh get started on
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;yesterday <laughter> yesterday was mother's day and uh my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and
aw;we spent the day together and it was very very nice
that sounds like a great situation;oh um easygoing um easy to be around um friendly happy
uh huh;<deep breath> hmm i would like to work on being um more focused on on uh projects
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;oh gosh probably when i was a kid you know kids can be uh kids can be cruel to each other uh so nothing that um i still at this age take personally or or you know hold a grudge for
okay;um sure everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;mm i don't <do> i don't know i i can't answer that one

yeah;ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep <laughter> um oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh telling her i was gay i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear
okay;okay
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um when i was a little kid my um my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road and he uh scrubbed_entry and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just uh like seeing death like that really just threw me off and uh frightened me and uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and uh it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face

that's so good to hear;um my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to uh you know pursue my dreams and not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her
uh huh;usually it's easy um sometimes it's not
can you tell me about that;um well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week but while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when i should be i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but still wanna stay up i guess
what are you like when you don't sleep well;uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter>
mm;um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um but yeah i think that answers the question

okay;no

thanks for sharing your thoughts with me;thank you that was interesting
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes thanks
okay;i'm well thank you how are you
that's good;i grew up in oklahoma
really;mhm
when did you move to l_a;um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here
how often do you go back to your hometown;my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much
how does it compare to l_a;<sniffle> oklahoma's very different um uh l_a's a lot more exciting there's a lot more um uh to do here and um uh the ocean obviously is very nice so
mhm;um you know that's a good question i um i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come
are you happy you did that;very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made
that's so good to hear;<laughter>
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural it seemed like a good fit um i just really like it here
how do you like your living situation;oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice
awesome;mm i studied philosophy and um political theory and government and did a little bit of english literature on the side
how did you decide to do that;um it kind of just happened naturally i think uh i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different areas and i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that
are you still working in that;um not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities
mhm;um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often
what's your dream job;<laughter> um you know i have actually studied to become a success coach um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams
how hard is that;um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that um you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too
yeah;um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so
why;um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged and i think that um is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers
okay;<laughter> pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time
has that gotten you in trouble;not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;hmm hmm i'm not sure it would've probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would've been a friendly argument um probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually can't remember the specific time
mm;<laughter> <sniffle> mm i meditate um i do that almost every day um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts
mhm;so that's nice
that's good;mm well let me think about that for a minute <sigh> hmm <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle> <sigh> hmm
let's come back to that later;okay i'm sorry <laughter>
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;hmm well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but um i do have it sometimes probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it you know if i didn't have it um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i study and attend class the way i should have um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating and i'm not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so
mhm;no i don't think so um at least not not that i'm aware of
okay;<sniffle> i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um i when i used to live there when he was younger um spent a lot of time with them and since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them um and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so that's um that makes me feel bad sometimes
i understand;mm um well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's younger and um he's like four four and a half years younger he's married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them um on my father's side there's one brother um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so
okay;um i'd say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbed_entry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice
that's so good to hear;i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful um and i can sleep uh you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i don't remember it so
uh huh;um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i um sleep poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate and um i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle
okay;i would say good um summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;not really i can't i can't think of anything um there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um and i hike with friends and um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated um because i didn't really exercise when i was there and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like
i'm sorry;it's okay thank you
have you ever been diagnosed with p_t_s_d;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;hmm well scrubbed_entry he's a lot of fun and um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun
how would your best friend describe you;hmm <sigh> well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and um that i you know care about others uh and that i'm loyal and i'm not sure what else um i think those those are probably the main things
okay;<sniffle> um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so um i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging um and i wish that i um xxx i don't know uh i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things
okay;mm hmm so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i don't feel like she was um i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh used to push my buttons or so i thought and so um one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer um and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was um but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people <peo> with staff members
yeah;and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it and um i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so
yeah;<laughter> so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago
hmm;<sigh> probably scrubbed_entry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so
okay;<sigh> let's see well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore uh and i got to fly first class um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too
nice;sure thank you
goodbye;bye

okay;um in the past but it's treated
how long ago were you diagnosed;um five years ago
what got you to seek help;uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to to doctor and um they helped me and i did uh psychotherapy
do you still go to therapy now;yeah for the p_t_s_d though
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um i don't know i guess uh it's just um just kind of supportive because <be> because of the issues i have with my family it's it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing
mhm;i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes yeah thanks
i'm sorry;oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i xxx i xxx i xxx before i go to sleep i sort of like um meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help
uh huh;i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so
that's great;mhm
how would your best friend describe you;uh i guess you know as a a nice person i'm thoughtful um a good friend um <sigh> and happy fun person
mhm;um i don't know i mean i'm in my forties now so i'm pretty happy with with myself my <m> you know my um you know uh i've i've done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty um happy with myself now
okay;uh well <we> that would that would be um my parents they're very abusive so i don't <d> i <d> i don't talk to them anymore so <laughter> um any you know any times with them you know they they uh you know said <sai> did terrible things to me so i prefer not to talk about it
okay;uh let's see um well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about uh a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book mhm
nice;um i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places and and do a bit of cleaning and um uh just uh relax
that's good;oh yeah i would <wou> i would say um to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship
yeah;um just just <j> the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and and i guess you know i'm i'm proud of you know with my work like decisions i've made that um that give me um you <y> you know a a a a uh a job that i i like that gives me a lot of flexibility and i you know i do what i like and <sigh> um and you know people like my work and um and also my my dogs i'm really proud of them and um yeah i guess <gu> i don't know <laughter>

okay i think i have asked everything i need to;<synch> yes i'm fine thank you new york city yes uh seventy <s> nineteen seventy five <f> five <laughter> about <bout> once a year both urban uh big cities but uh east coast has a little bit maybe a little more character west coast a little more weighed back with family came with my family i was young <sigh> i like the weather i like the women are beautiful the culture is fantastic the um eh you know the city affords a lot of uh opportunities education <educa> uh uh employment wise eh lots of um lots of good things traffic um people who only care about themselves i can't see your shoes <laughter> uh i've traveled a bit europe and uh throughout the states yeah uh the new the new experiences it's always fun to travel to get a break from where you are and experiece <ex> have new experiences xxx and the great thing about it too is when you return home it kinda helps you reset your it kinda makes <ma> appreciate <appreci> makes you appreciate coming home as well well <laughter> you know i've been to spain and um england and italy different uh different places <laughter> probably barcelona loved barcelona the architecture and the the food <f> well food was uh was a part of it but just the the my experiences there were fantastic art history <sigh> i was always good artistically so it seemed a natural probably should've studied graphic design which i later got into to be um the star of my own t_v show <laughter> <laughter> i would be the most hilarious comedian making the entire country laugh at my brilliant comedic point of view on life <laughter> outgoing always have been as an actor as a uh kind of a comedian i do comedy <c> i'm a comedian as well and you have to be outgoing it's more fun <laughter> <sigh> try to take a peaceful walk do yoga much better i used to be i think when i was younger not so good lately i'm actually very proud of it i think the only time i really argue is on the phone with time warner cable <laughter> i don't know it's been awhile mm maybe not working hard enough some days um when you're a freelancer it's hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive <laughter> um <whispering to himself> handled differently well <sigh> i don't know um can we come back to that one i can't think right now uh <whispering to himself> hardest xxx i've ever had to make uh probably once when i moved back to los angeles from boston and i had a girlfriend at the time and it was hard to leave i knew i had to had to come back but it i think it mm that particular move west was um felt it was calling me and that's where my connections were and i had to come home <sniffle> i think so yes <laughter> um erase from my memory <sigh> i don't know <kn> gosh i mean i don't know <ss> something you feel guilty about <ab> um maybe you know <laughter> uh maybe doing something when you're a little you've had a couple of extra drinks and you made out with a girl <laughter> that you shouldn't have eh uh it's pretty good i think um they're a challenge they're my folks are together got a sister my sister's in new york not the tightest family but you know eh i'm i'm proud <prou> i'm uh grateful for everything that i've derived from it i have a best friend that i went to college with and he's very smart i consistently call him uh when i'm having uh challenges life challenges um i will consistently call this specific <sp> well a few specific friends to get advice and i like <li> i like that i have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential and supportive friends are good friends are very important sometimes uh most of the time not horrible but not amazing <ama> i mean it's okay <laughter> uh dragging tired <ti> uh not motivated or um yeah pretty good pretty good i'd say <s> um no i mean they're i think they're consistent with the way i've been for a while <sniffle> no no <deep breath> <sigh> i think when i get consistent work when i get a lot of do a lot of creative stuff get a lot done creatively uh i guess <laughter> i would hope something like um you know a charismatic fun loyal guy <laughter> um <ss> i wish i were more um more <m> more aggressive more consistent with um pursuing dreams i do a lot i do enough sometimes i get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things i love to do um well recently <laughter> recently i signaled into a lane <laughter> this woman was shouting at me i could hear it 'cause our windows were open it was a hot summer day and then later i drove up beside her and i said in a pleasant way i said i was just trying to signal to get into your lane 'cause she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she lifted up her finger <f> just lifted up her finger <laughter> and gave me the finger and it was just it's funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad <laughter> <laughter> a little angry no 'cause i took the high road <laughter> but she <laughter> regrets i'm sure um just go out with friends make dinner recently a bunch of i had a you know small party at my house and one guy cooked food and we had a bunch of friends over and that's always fun um let's see never get too up or too down too high don't um accentuate the highs and lows because there's always a different it's a roller <roller> endless rollercoaster so you need to be prepared for the for that long ride creative things the creative the performances the comedic performances the commercials i've done the acting the stand-up comedy the graphic design all my creative filmmaking all my creative outlets that that are an expression of me buh bye <laughter>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yeah i am
okay;um good to moderate
that's good;los angeles
really;yeah i'm from
what are some things you really like about l_a;um just a lot of different kinds of people and um eh i love the weather most of the time and um great creative scene i'm i'm really into music so um it's a great scene for that
cool;i i don't like driving <laughter> i don't know who does right i it's just it's just such a drag and uh
yeah;getting from point a to point b is just a daily need and it doesn't get any easier it's too many people
i see what you mean;too many people <laughter>
yeah;<laughter>
i'm sure you can tell by my shoes i'm not much of a world explorer do you travel a lot;i can't see your shoes um uh yeah when i can uh when <whe> when i can afford to
what do you enjoy about traveling;um <sigh> just being somewhere else not having to drive usually most places have better public transportation um just i love <lo> i'm you know i'm a culture junkie i like experiencing different types of cultures so that's
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;xxx um well you know i haven't been to that many places i've been to like mexico and italy it it's uh you know i wanna go to more places i wanna go to japan so that'll be that'll be interesting it's usually just with my family um it's my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just uh yeah we go to italy we spent two weeks there though that was cool
nice;yeah
what's one of your most memorable experiences;um living next to the best gelato shop in italy in we <w> we were in florence <f> when we were in florence spent uh spent a week in florence
awesome;that was great very very good uh culture there as well art
okay;studied uh film and digital media 'cause uh i make music and i wanted to learn how to make music videos so it's something i'm trying to get into
are you still working in that;uh yeah yeah i mean i need to get a camera though that's the thing uh but um i mainly my main focus is music i studied film but my focus is music
can you tell me about that;um yeah <y> sure i've been playing music i've been playing guitar uh keyboard bass drums for um for about twelve years now and uh i do uh production and songwriting i'm in a indie rock band scrubbed_entry
(laughter;um that's a great website i highly recommend it and it's uh it's mine so check it out
okay;uh international rockstar music producer and uh filmmaker director
mhm;probably outgoing
why;um just just feel like it's a way to get the best <be> most out of life uh just talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it's uh kinda just goes with the territory <caritor> territory <laughter>
that makes sense;<laughter> yeah um i uh do meditation and
how hard is that;uh it's not really hard 'cause it's fun and it it relaxes me and helps me focus at the same time which uh you know that that was a huge epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time 'cause normally when i'm relaxing i'm i'm tuning out i'm focusing on something else but um to be able to combine those sensations was uh yeah i've been doing that for about uh three months now so
that's good;yeah it is
how are you at controlling your temper;um almost too good at times <laughter> uh sometimes uh there's things that should be said that i that i don't um just because um you know it's like you're opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example i got a problem with him but they don't have a problem with him necessarily 'cause he didn't do anything to them
hmm;and uh i've had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but um you know i make do
okay;um <makes sound with mouth> probably argued with uh the guitarist from my band uh we had a falling out we're not gonna be in a band together i mean we're still friends so at least there's that mm but um it was just basically about creative control of the project and how we're gonna prioritize it in in our lives and uh you know we just our priorities weren't the same and i got very upset so that was the end of that
how did you feel in that moment;um <sigh> i felt good that it was definitive that it was you know a choice had been made on both parties uh also regretful that you know he didn't feel the way that i wanted him to feel about it which was excited about the project so
yeah;the fact that he wasn't really in it kinda pissed me off um but
i understand;i got over it um and you know i got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me you know even honored so you know i'm uh i'ma keep going
that's great;thank you
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;um <sigh> hmm i don't know i don't really i don't really have any regrets like that at the moment i can't really think of any um
what's something you feel guilty about;<deep breath> um when i was in high school i cheated on my girlfriend i didn't think it would mean anything at the time but i did it i i regret it but um you know xxx you know life happens you make some mistakes
yeah;selfishness um being young and thinking it wouldn't matter
i see;um you know thinking you know you only live once and you know for eh it was probably for the best ultimately 'cause you know i love my current girlfriend and i would never do that to her so that was <wa> that was years ago but uh she was a nice girl she didn't deserve that so i regret it
okay;<deep breath> um shit geez um i guess uh whether to go to college or not 'cause uh i uh i had some projects going in l_a that i didn't really wanna shut off uh i i had a band going we had a manager um we were playing out a lot and i wasn't sure if i wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and um i made the decision to go to school in santa cruz and and start a new life there for four years and it it was a difficult decision but i'm glad i did 'cause i met a lot of people a lot of people i'm still close with today that you know we work on stuff together and all that so it's good
that's good;i agree it is good <laughter> thank you <laughter>
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um maybe i wish i could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when i was four by a danish babysitter uh you know on the abuse scale it's pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and i i don't forget it so i have a pretty vivid picture of it and i'm i'm i'd be happier if it wasn't there
okay;it's positive they're supportive um they give me a hard time sometimes because they don't think that i keep things in perspective in terms of how i'm gonna support myself even though i do it's just um you know i have a a more long range picture than they do and i have faith in myself and the creative projects that i make so
mm;yeah there's a bit of tension there just 'cause you know they expect certain things from me and i expect them as well but i just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer
yeah;but they're sweet people
how do you cope with them;how do i cope with them uh i you know they're lovely people at their core you know um cope with them 'cause i love them i just uh you know at times i'll just uh go off on my own for a while and eh you know take a breather whatever you know xxx everyone makes you mad sometimes so
uh huh;<deep breath>
yeah;challenging
why;um <sigh> i just i try and it doesn't work um sometimes i have to take medication for it i have to take ambien something like that um yeah it's difficult <di>
what are you like when you don't sleep well;i'm someone who sleeps in late so i always get at least six or seven hours if i have to wake up early for something um i get nauseous sometimes i'll throw up in the morning um yeah i've had jobs where i'd wake up and you know vomit while i'm brushing my teeth it's horrible
that sucks;it does suck um it's kinda something i'm worried about you know i i kinda need to get some part time work while i'm not you know getting a steady pay flow for my music production so yeah <sigh> it's pretty rough <sigh> got some stuff i need to get over i'm not really sure how
like what;just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there's something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something i that doesn't sit well with me like being in a you know a a rushed and you know stressful work environment it just um unless it's about something that i care about you know like music or the arts it's just very hard to to give a shit frankly like and you know i i try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe i'll have a red bull or something and you know xxx my body doesn't want that in the morning it just i feel like my body rejects things and yeah
yeah;okay i've been feeling okay very uh very reflective very contemplative you know there's gonna be some changes and there's gonna be some new people in my life some new people uh in my band um you know i'm gonna try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time 'cause you know i expect more from myself it's just pissing me off when my get my you know i basically feel like i'm shitting all over myself my body's shitting on me anyway just by being so um shitty <laughter> yeah
hmm;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;um i was diagnosed um about uh twelve years ago i haven't been in therapy since um they gave me zoloft and i didn't like it
why;it made me feel worse than i do in the shittiest moments i was telling you about it it uh it made me feel numb um i don't wanna feel numb i wanna feel everything even if it sucks
i understand;being forced to it was a private school they thought i was acting up thought i was a uppity kid i think i was just being a kid so
do you feel like therapy is useful;yes i do
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;um well i haven't been in in twelve years but i do think that it might be helpful for me in the future
can you tell me about that;i thought you weren't a therapist that's a typical therapist question right there <laughter>
(laughter;um well yeah i uh uh i i kinda wanna go back to therapy it might help might help me find some solutions maybe maybe it's not a therapist i need maybe it's a life coach i have no idea but i'll be seeking help soon
okay;um yesterday i was watching a movie with my girlfriend and i looked over at her we smiled at each other and it was it was it was great
aw;yeah
how would your best friend describe you;um very honest um sometimes brutally so but i'm a good guy i think that my friends all think i'm a good guy probably funny um open-minded
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um i guess well it's what i'm working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through my body rejecting shittiness of the world <laughter>
okay;it gets better <sigh> um stay in shape it gets harder the longer you wait um don't give up on your dreams keep doing what you're doing
mhm;my music
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome nice talking to you
goodbye;<synch>
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing fine
that's good;i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah
really;i was yes
how often do you go back to your hometown;uh i've never been back there
why;um don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there
okay;um <makes sound with mouth> <laughter> well my my family's here
mhm;that's one uh the weather's great uh the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good
yeah;uh the traffic which is probably <probab> probably most people say um it's expensive to live here those are probably the top two
i see what you mean;uh recently i've traveled
what do you enjoy about traveling;um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week
nice;uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid
yeah;trying to you know say you know what's this what's this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult
mhm;i'm probably more of a shy person
why;genetics i don't know why
what did you study at school;um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction i've also studied uh computer networking
cool;um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain
are you happy you did that;mm uh it's given me a lot of opportunity but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life
what's your dream job;well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training
what made you decide to do that;um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them
that's great;well in my immediate family um i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family
how close are you to your family;um i'm really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents
i see;um i'd say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me
can you tell me about that;um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible
okay;um i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when you know i'll i'll get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to
right;to keep so when <whe> when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;um <sigh> well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadn't really in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and
yeah;and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was
how did you feel in that moment;um are you asking the moment of during the conflict
yeah;uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger
mm;so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger
okay;mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didn't feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me
yeah;tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory
mhm;um oh let me see i'm not sure um i don't know i i can't really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase
okay;um usually usually it's not too bad um are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping
yeah;um the the job i work the the um kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts so um coming home in the morning you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work
i understand;uh it pretty easy
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky
how have you been feeling lately;uh i i've been feeling good lately
that's good;no not really
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um hmm i don't know um can't think of anything that was kinda out of the ordinary but um yesterday we my wife and i took took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one um stayed with her grandma but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played and yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park
that's so good to hear;um i i think he'd say i'm a a family man that um i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me um usually my my friend i end up doing um different work around the house for him 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice
mhm;um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that
uh huh;now if it's
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult uh advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um that's about it
okay;think that would made that would've made the biggest difference in my life i think
what are you most proud of in your life;um well i have i have four kids and i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that that um you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them through their their journey in life and i hope that they end up a little better for it than than me um yeah i just hope hope kinda through them that i can you know leave <lea> leave something worthwhile
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome
goodbye;goodbye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;sure
okay;<laughter> mm good i guess
where are you from originally;new orleans louisiana
really;uh two thousand five
how often do you go back to your hometown;i used to go back often but not much anymore
why;uh just things happened
okay;uh <laughter> uh well guess you're not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five
wow;not really
can you tell me about that;um hmm where to begin uh just l_a's different culturally i have a different culture out here it's just a different place
mhm;um it's it's bike friendly louisiana isn't new orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful
what are some things you don't really like about l_a;<sigh> the drivers they're crazy
(laughter;mm not really kind of but not much anymore
why;don't have the money kinda broke <laughter>
i understand;just being able to go on an adventure
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;um let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike um and that that was pretty fun kinda scary and dangerous nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter>
what's one of your most memorable experiences;traveling or just in general
whatever comes to your mind;hmm um i gotta say i gotta say we were we were heading out of um we were heading off the p_c_h and going into um laguna and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic and i i remember going down the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click and i was like oh god and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going down a hill unable to brake and i'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from
(laughter;rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot
oh my gosh;so yeah yeah that's it
okay;<laughter>
what did you study at school;um various different things uh anthropology visual effects kinda weird but yeah
that sounds interesting;um i just i've always had a fascination with film and i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the the mob mentality of people
yeah;especially
what's your dream job;ooh dream job um huh i have no idea just a job i guess
okay;i consider myself more outgoing
why;um you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me like people xxx i i i like people i don't know
mhm;i'm not i'm not afraid of what they think eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me
i see what you mean;eh
sometimes when i'm feeling tense i turn on the fish tank screensaver hey i know it's not hawaii but it's the best i've got what do you do to relax;um <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music um yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping
uh huh;i like sleeping it's fun
how are you at controlling your temper;uh <mumbling> not good
has that gotten you in trouble;<laughter> frequently <laughter>
can you tell me about that;um <sigh> uh in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker um yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended um i don't know yeah things like that just getting into fights
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;<sigh> um like a serious argument
whatever comes to your mind;um <sigh> uh i guess like xxx argument over over um uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws i mean
uh huh;it was like yesterday evening
how did you feel in that moment;eh it was it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into that that's kinda what you specified i think
okay;ooh um uh my entire life um <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh> i have um about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil ex and um yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean uh eh <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then like just as a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like a hundreds plus miles in a singular day
hmm;and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk um and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating 'cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death
yeah;<deep breath> <sigh> hmm um i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept
mm;and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is i'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably
what made you decide to do that;um xxx <sigh> ooh um <sigh> where do i begin <sigh> um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i <deep breath> <laughter> you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened
okay;oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um <laughter> my <m> my ex i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina 'cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it but it's still it's it's still there and i think uh i i don't know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is <i> is just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know <laughter> earthquakes <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming
yeah;yes
have you been diagnosed with depression;<laughter> yeah
how long ago were you diagnosed;<sigh> um mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times that's no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which would've been <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago i don't know xxx i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's it's when i first was told that i was depressed
mhm;um as far as p_t_s_d goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing
what got you to seek help;um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it um you know just kinda happened
do you still go to therapy now;no not not anymore
why did you stop;um eh <sigh> <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter> uh geez uh you know i really don't know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore
do you feel like therapy is useful;uh sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know
right;um <sigh> i guess it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on
yeah;<sigh> um wow <laughter> um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out
that's so good to hear;um well for starters i mean you <y> you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh i'd i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um <sigh> i don't know uh make myself less fat <laughter> um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know
yeah;like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too
i see what you mean;i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much
okay;um <sigh> um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way
(laughter;um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh asperger's so that's a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric 'cause i totally am i just i i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive and you know who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for so i should you know live while i'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm
yeah;except when i'm reading and i like reading
okay;<sigh> um uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up um i think i would've told myself at the time um 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known my my evil ex um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted um and more importantly don't <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that
mm;and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it
okay;<sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive maybe yeah uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride i don't really feel pride i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter>
yeah;i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;do i press the button now oh bye
yeah;okay
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm doing well
that's good;i was born in oakland
really;um <sigh> all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here
mhm;the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality
i see what you mean;<laughter> i i don't i would love to travel more
what do you enjoy about traveling;um <sigh> being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective
uh huh;um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family
nice;um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting
mhm;um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah
that's great;right now i'm getting my master's in social work
what's your dream job;<laughter> dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics
okay;i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful
that makes sense;<laughter> um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things
mhm;also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise
cool;pretty good i don't get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that
that's good;hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend i've had for a few years
hmm;i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions
okay;i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me
mhm;hmm <laughter> that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did
okay;mm <clears throat> hardest decision <sigh> wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on
yeah;um <sigh> i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program
that makes sense;<sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh> oh <laughter> um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind
i'm sorry to hear that;um <laughter> <laughter> i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family
uh huh;um so in general i'm not really that close to family
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things
that's great;<sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up
why;because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed
i understand;<clears throat>
how do you cope with them;i think just <sigh> self-talk about how what i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going
mhm;<sigh> feeling <sigh> uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time
uh huh;no i haven't
have you been diagnosed with depression;yes
how long ago were you diagnosed;in two thousand six
what got you to seek help;the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed
yeah;yes i do
do you feel like therapy is useful;yes
what sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy;i notice i'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them i'm <sigh> able to think <th> think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas <clears throat>
that's good;mm <sigh> um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again
awesome;<laughter> um <sigh> people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual
uh huh;um i wish that i did not or wait i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy
okay;<laughter> start going to therapy now <laughter> um but yeah i really would and also to what how old am i twenty eight ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career
okay;um i think the fact that i'm in grad school and coming from the background that i that i come from low socio-economic status and just pushing through challenges to get here
that's so good to hear;<laughter>
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome
goodbye;bye

how did you feel in that moment;unsure <un> unsure unstable i don't like loud talking or mm loud emotion i like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice
yeah;hmm most recently with the illness of my friend i wish i would've handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that i really needed to tell her otherwise the way they really needed to be done i took her advice where i shouldn't of
i see;um we he i was engaged to him fifteen years ago and he recently called me i guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and i asked my husband if i could go help him in his time of need and i'm here
wow;it has been
what made you decide to do that;um a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well two my son wanted to start his career out here three i love the weather and that's all i can think of at the moment <laughter>
i see what you mean;mhm
tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make;uh it would be the the death of my youngest son
can you tell me about that;i don't know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early i had him in five months versus nine the we we made the decision to take him off life support 'cause he wasn't getting any better so that would've been the the hardest decision i made with my husband
yeah;mhm
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;um i really don't wanna erase anything from my memory i've actually um learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so i'm not <ss> i'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind i categorize them and place them in memories
okay;uh it's very close lost my mother at a young age and uh all of us siblings and my father still remain very close
that's good;mm my father
can you tell me about that;oh he's very health conscious very energetic and exercises <e> uh exercises and has a spirituality about him that uh i want to have as well it's a contentment that he that he portrays that i that i would like to have as well
mhm;no problem
what are you like when you don't sleep well;very confused or um skittish i guess would be the word
how have you been feeling lately;lately fine <f> fine except for the fact that my um good friend who i'm helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so it's been a little hectic the last two days
yeah;um no not lately
okay;no i have not
have you been diagnosed with depression;no i have not
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;um i was excited um with good friends in good company i should say and um i had just got back from a concert so it was outside it was enjoyable music i was with good friends we ate well and enjoyed the moment
that sounds like a great situation;uh as a giving spiritual normal person i don't know <laughter>
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;um i can't think of anything that i'd wanna change except for maybe exercise a little more
hmm;i i can't recall one off hand
okay;no
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;to have save more money and to not try and accomplish everything at once
uh huh;i started out in cosmetology then i went into um college have some college in mathematics and finance
what's your dream job;traveling
okay;mm i had a lot <lo> i like to i enjoy um good food nice wine and company i just went last night to a very nice italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family and we dined and talked and that was fun
nice;most proud of i guess it would be my children
okay i think i have asked everything i need to;you're welcome
goodbye;bye bye
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;i'm fine thank you
that's good;detroit michigan
really;yes
when did you move to l_a;i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago
mm;uh i don't go back to detroit anymore
why;i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and
that makes sense;uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe
mhm;that i that i like better
why did you move to l_a;after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at
how easy was it for you to get used to living in l_a;extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it
that's good;well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh less crowded it's more open space it's a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens
i see what you mean;the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like
yeah;i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all so i don't travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide
what do you enjoy about traveling;new experiences
i'd love to hear about one of your trips;well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i've traveled a lot of different places and um i'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience
uh huh;uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso i've also visited uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different
yeah;i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing
okay;i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike
mhm;listen to music you know
how are you at controlling your temper;i'm very good at controlling my temper
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him
okay;it could be it could be a choice of
tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently;uh some of the instances when i might've been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm
yeah;um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so
i see what you mean;well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious outcome for them as well
yeah;mhm
tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory;<sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the uh impact of the event 'cause there might be something that
mm;you can gain from that
yeah;but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so
right;um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here
mhm;so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment
yeah;well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have
mm;pardon i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat
who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life;hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends
can you tell me about that;well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have um been very um positive <po> positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so
okay;it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but um in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done
i see what you mean;i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so um but in general good
have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately;like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out
okay;no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have
right;i have not no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be
yeah;you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel
i understand;um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat
is there anything you regret;um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see you know you could've done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that
what advice would you give to yourself ten or twenty years ago;i would have um made myself move to california sooner and i'm i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss> would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information <in> information available
yeah;you know after you have looked at several options
mhm;of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself
that's great;okay
goodbye;bye bye now
hi i'm ellie thanks for coming in today i was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment i'm not a therapist but i'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you i'll ask a few questions to get us started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential are you ok with this;yes
okay;fine
that's good;oh san fernando valley
really;uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around
mhm;it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system
i see what you mean;uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel
when was the last time that happened;um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class
nice;yeah it was fun
what's one of your most memorable experiences;hmm <sigh> i think it's tough to say
whatever comes to your mind;um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night
awesome;philosophy
are you still working in that;yes
how did you decide to do that;um hmm i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy
that makes sense;huh i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it
okay;i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly
uh huh;um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read um yeah
how are you at controlling your temper;i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing
when was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about;i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with
yeah;well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out
i see;hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him
okay;hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year
i'm sorry;uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um <sigh> and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve
that's good;scrubbed_entry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that
that's great;i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning
what are you like when you don't sleep well;um well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just groggy
okay;pretty good i'm a little anxious about um about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time um yeah
how do you cope with them;<sigh> well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic
okay;no
have you been diagnosed with depression;no
tell me about the last time you felt really happy;hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun
that's great;um she would probably say that i'm smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v um and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot
what are some things you wish you could change about yourself;well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating
tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself;hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job but it was was not great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation
that sucks;well i would've been twelve and two um but i think i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then
is there anything you regret;i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and um i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript
could you have done anything to avoid it;i think so i'm i think i i wasn't focusing in school at that time and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that
okay;hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping
mhm;and maybe watching a little bit of t_v
what are you most proud of in your life;huh well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm ten years older than him so and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are
